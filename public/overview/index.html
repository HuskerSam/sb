        <br>avoid out of date workers that have little incentive to reskill and weight down the salary pool
        <br>provide ability to retire assets early (contract basis to start if possible)
        <br>get 2 "brains" on the team that cover knowledge across the product
        <br>Hiring of wives and husbands is ok - this is a solid option for existing companies to either meet or get a lot closer to the requirements for top management. Many well paid people of either sex have a supporting spouse.

      <div class="rant-header">PROCESS SCHEMING</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        core of process/technique is to remove “the requirement” of expert level talent at every point in the process
        <br>any piece of the regular process (adding features/content - building, releaseing, branding, etc etc) - should be regular tasks
        <br>high talent and skill should focus on features - not infastructure

        <br>Recruitment of talent - no entry level workers envision working on an all male team
        <br>Experience gained at an early age is very valuable to professionals of all genders

        Both: teach and collaborate on the newest and coolest techniques
        <br>Product Team: avoid paying people who leave before they are productive
        <br>Both: do work on a per project basis (even if salaried employee)
        <br>we only finish projects - if longer then a few months then a decent phase
        <br>barter in training and payback with each project
        <br>committed to helping talent acquire skills, at the same time, we’re committed to production
        <br>We pay what we can - but when something else pays a lot more, or has something cooler to do, lets make it smooth
        <br>We keep the projects and phases reasonable in length and you finish them
        <br>MVP creation phase should run 3-6 months (with 4-6 weeks of actual billable work).
        <br>production and support lifespan should run 5-10 years (competitive for features per iteration without a rewrite).
