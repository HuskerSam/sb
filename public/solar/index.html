    Earth's moon is a spaceship and temporary mini planet used for intra and inter solar system travel
    named "Luna".
    <br>Moon is a planet engineering tool that spins the planet causing night/day cycles, warms the core causing the planet materials to mix, once the core becomes molten it tried to tidally local with the sun in the planets orbit, where the planet
    is spinning due to the pull of the orbiting moon creating a protective magnetic field (known as the Van Allen Belt on Earth). The dust emitted from the star the planet is orbiting creates back pressure allowing much greater atmospheric pressure
    then otherwise gravity would allow.

    <br>The inner most planet of a solar system is consumed first, once it’s core is heated and used up, each successive planet further out in the solar system is consumed. Many moons are used to convert gaseous planets into more solid forms that
    can be used, small moon are used to hibernate ready to use planets (Mars moons list here).

    <br><br>When needed a moon is placed in orbit around the moon to create a mini planet, including a magnetic field so it can travel intra planet to planet in the solar system. Inter solar system travel is more fuzzy … moon absorbs particle
    collisions in open space (versus a small craft with shielding - the moon is many times bigger then small particles that are hard to see - so the life forms would ride on “back” of the moon)


    <br><br>Mercury was used first, venus second - the planet still is rotating backwards from sling shotting the moon to earth. Mars is ready with 2 small moons keeping it warmed up (making hydrocarbons and water) - venus and mercury have none as
    they’re dead and used up planets.

    <br><br>750 million years ago venus green house ran away (planets ability to make more hydrocarbons was exhausted)

    <br><br>Ratio for uranium 235/238 tells the age of a planets usefulness (are all planets of this ratio)

    <br><br>Sun creates uranium and heavy elements and feeds them to planets - moon concentrates and activates the core - using them up - planet is burned until solar system collapses


    <br><br><br><br>A planets core creates and cycles u235 at a very slow rate - scattered evening through out the crust - mixing and churning a planets matter generates veins of like material, enabling natural reactors (3 bill years ago on earth)

    This diagram shows the moons effect on the contortions of the planets shape

    <br> theory displayed: the moon causes the earth to contort and remix it's elements - creating veins - and concentrations of the heaviest metals at the core
    <br> this creates the heat and volcanism that leads both earthquakes and volcanos - but also produces the critical internal heat to generate petroleum
    <br> this petroleum pump is capable of running until the 235/238 ratio is exhaused - like venus

    <br> backpressure makes it possible for atmospheres


    <br> consider "wind up" reverse force - such as releasing the core's inertia allowing it to build up massively in the opposite direction to all at once stop the planets rotation
    <br> consider a small body orbiting a large body - both travelling - any incoming fragments would hit the big body via gravity
