    <h2>Quick Tips</h2>
    The default camera provided for scenes is the Arc Rotate camera. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, or on touch enabled devices you can use gestures.
    Hold down the right mouse button to move the camera target, and the left mouse button allows you to rotate around the target.
    <br>
    To search for items, expand the element type (shape or mesh, etc) and use ctrl f (browser find) to filter through the names - opening and closing an item will move it to the far left in the list
    <br>
    The default light provided is a hemispheric light, from (0.2, 0.8, 0.2). The intensity is adjustable - 1.0 is approximately sunlight. If you add a light to a block (or any child block), the default light is disabled.
    <br>
    Blocks also function as scenes, and a skybox and ground can be added to a block. The skybox doesn't show if the block is being used as a child block.
    <br>
    A few shortcuts have been added to accelerate prototyping.
    <br>
    For materials, to specify a material that is just an rgb (0-1 levels) color, use the format "color:r,g,b" - i.e. "color:1,0,0" is red. This sets the diffuse color of the material, the most reactive to light.
    <br>
    To set the emissive color, use "ecolor:1,0,0", or to set both the diffuse and emissive, use "decolor:1,0,0".
    <br>

    For textures, there is an image library available using the prefix "sb: 123.jpg".
    <br>
    For meshes, there is an babylon file library available using the prefix "sb: mesh.babylon".
    <br>
    The idea of these files is to provide a number of usable images and meshes for quick consumption in your scene. You can always upload the pictures and meshes you
    need as your project matures.
