  <h1>Your quality content on Android TV</h1>
  If you need a platform to get the most out of multiple screen options to deliver lots of video that is driven by user choice you've found the place!
  <br>
  Using a mix of platforms at the same time with synchronized content allows people in different rooms and different places to share the same experience.
  Using a realtime data source (with push capability) like <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> allows us to efficently push indexed content changes
  to TV applications in addition to rapidly synchronizing screens and choices amongst users.
  <br>
  <br>
  We're here to deliver Android TV applications that expose <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/tv/discovery/searchable.html">searchable</a> content.  We use
  a wrapper application written in JAVA using Android Studio to host our web application.  This allows us to interact
  directly with the TV and it's special application modes for showing <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/tv/discovery/recommendations-row.html">recommendations</a>.
  While the native application is in JAVA the logic remains in javascript.  <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/">Crosswalk</a> is used
  for a browser that supports WebGL and Firebase on Android TV's 5.0 and up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Our process delivers a solution for markets such as public broadcasting, music videos,
  local tv, radio and news organizations.  We want to provide a solution where a company has development resources to sustain
  an all platform solution (especially if it's in one language html/javascript), but not the expertise and funds to develop a competitive
  and foward leaning solution in house.  Anyone that has a lot of video content, especially high resolution, will want
  quality interfaces with Android TV and Roku.
<br><br>
  Video sources are commonly described using <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> meta tags.  Our goal is to use the tags
  to describe videos (thumbnails, title, source and description).  We use additional tags for videos of lower and
  higher bit rates.  Previewing content for TV has already been solved on the web - if you share links and content
  with other sites now, it will only take small (if any) adjustments to improve your existing video tags.  The advantage
  to additional tags is delivering bandwidth specific content - your phone on a weak connection doesn't require or perform
  well with 4k quality video - but your TV looks like crap without it.  Most video sites let a user select the video quality
  as an option that is saved on a per machine (not account) basis to match up with different platforms.  We take the local
  setting and match it up with the video source in the tags to find the right url.
