    <b>Late bound naming system</b><br>
    side note about "relationships" - one of the reasons I use the "CSV" term - is I relate rows by "textkeys" (columns) - CSV seems to indicate keep the "internal ids" to a minimum - not quite "sql" (autogen id heavy) - not quite nosql with the
    child/json structure. So that's why I'm using "CSV" - in my app I'm name matching a lot this way (only ~6 record types - so not that crazy for this) - but keeps the data "mutable" - when I'm creating something related to something, that
    related something doesn't need to exist yet - I just need to know what it's going to be named.

    So if I have "storeisle" - and I want 5 sub items, "storeisle_floor", and "storeisle_ceiling", ... etc - they don't need to exist yet in my work flow - I create them later. Versus sql, where we'd need the "id". This is still an "id" - just
    "late bound" (I match it up later) - versus "early bound" - where it's more or less internal/compiled.

    Can make things slower and more complicated if used at the wrong times. But spreadsheet driven size of complexity is the types of processes are what I've done for a long time. And definitely the statroute is a "spreadsheet" manageable type
    of design complication.
