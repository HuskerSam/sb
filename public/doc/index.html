  <h1>Firebase Development Services</h1> Seeking javascript based opportunities using the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Firebase provides infrastructure for web applications.</b>
  Firebase allocates (scales) on demand the needed hardware to meet your immediate needs.  If your web application
  doesn't have much traffic today, Firebase will only charge you only accordingly.  If you site does a ton of business, Firebase
  will scale and deliver your application - at a high cost.
  <br>
  <br><b>How is this different from the past?</b>  In the past you needed to have the servers ready and running to meet a large demand.  If you don't have the traffic you're hosting the hardware
  and bandwidth for - you pay for it anyways.  If you don't have enough servers running to host your site, or some other related bottleneck (database, server center, even dns nameserver) -
  then when you big traffic bump arrives - your servers can't handle it - or at least handle it well.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>What services does Firebase supply?</b>
  Static hosting, a highly scalable nosql database and cloud functions are provided by Firebase to meet these needs.  Whether your site is intended
  to be high traffic or low traffic, Firebase will deliver you the hosting (and instant scaling) you need at a cost that goes with
  what you actually used.
