data will be purged from the deployment servers from time to time, usually weekly.  Please use handtopbuilder/builder as much as possible for "spam" work, we'll keep an eye on it.  Don't hesitate to use any of the servers in the Deploy Options list though.

% based values are useful when working with frame times - be careful to either add a "'" to the front i.e. 98% = '98%, or 98% = ="98%" in the cell.  Otherwise sheets calcs 98% = .98 - which equates to .98 ms.
