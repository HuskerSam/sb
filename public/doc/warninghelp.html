  data will be purged from the deployment servers from time to time, usually weekly. Please use handtopbuilder/builder as much as possible for "spam" work, we'll keep an eye on it. Don't hesitate to use any of the servers in the Deploy Options list
  though.

  Data created is "mostly" our property, your pictures, meshes and other data you upload is yours and your responsibility, we have no intention of claiming any rights to any of your work, or profiting from it directly or indirectly (other then
  debugging and idea purposes).

  % based values are useful when working with frame times - be careful to either add a "'" to the front i.e. 98% = '98%, or 98% = ="98%" in the cell. Otherwise sheets calcs 98% = .98 - which equates to .98 ms.
  <br><br>
  Sheets TIMEOUTS - functions must finish in 60 seconds or they fail - this at busy times of day (afternoon/evening USA) can cause intermitent fails - so check formula results and try again at times to make sure no errors
  <br><br>
  ADDON REFRESH TIMES - BE Patient with the add for best results, wait until the green uploading/deploying/refreshing data is done to navigate and change values - we know it's slow it likely always will be<br>
