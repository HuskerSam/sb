  <h1>Intro</h1> This application is written using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for the hosting and realtime data features.
  <a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/">Babylon.js</a> is used for the WebGL functionality, and their documentation is the technical reference to the animation functionality. This application targets rapidly developing scenes for consumption by javascript
  applications. Where features and functionality are quicker or easier to perform in code, they're left to be done there. That being said, for simple things like flowcharting and small animated videos this tool should do fine. Babylonjs provides strong
  reference materials, here is a <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101">short course</a> on it's abilities.

  <h1>Workspaces</h1>
  <img style="float:left;width:40%;padding:.25em" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hcwebflow/himage/addworkspace.jpg"> Create a new workspace for yourself after logging in. The default workspace is only a placeholder for new users. Feel free to
  view other workspaces - but please only add and change objects in the ones you're responsible for.
  <br>
  <h1>Quick Start</h1> Use the add panels different options for examples of shapes and blocks. The animated line uses % based times for the frames so once a line a generated, the flow rate of the dots can be changed by adjusting only the root blocks time. The text and shape
  does some simple positioning of 2 objects inside a block. Checkout textures and materials for the short cuts - a material can be made using just "ecolor: 0,0,1" (emissive purple) or "color: 1,.5,0" (diffuse orange).<br> There are built in image and
  mesh lists - you can replace a texture by using "sb: grass.jpg", and a similar deal with meshes. These collections will improve with time, but there should be enough there to get you started for rapid developing.
