        This product was created to attract and retain talented workers today and tomorrow for small (family raising) markets graduating nationally from respected colleges.
        This product addresses imbalances (opinion) in the workplace and culture with cash flows.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve heard modern work is about “technology (product), culture and workplace”. I believe it’s technology and team - and the culture and workplace will follow. Problem is you have to get the team, so this is some rules to convince players we
        run a good game!
        <br>
        <br>
        This product was created by a developer for developers. Fair isn’t equal - in families if females require more time in the bathroom per day, they get it - that’s fair. That’s the theme of this document, fair but not equal. Developers have
        for decades carved out tools and schemes for others to work, now is the time when we’ll need more directly to manipulate our local market as it’s converting to gigs - this tool is meant to cut out the noise in this environment - it’s
        ineffective enough as it is - get the loads and delays and penalties out as much as possible - this is what developers do and I”m here to help so you can get back to working on features.
        <br>
        <br>
        Promotes companies that are setup to succeed - companies built with profits paid out to the wrong parties end up with talent leaving and no longer on a strong iteration - whether they are still profitable or not - this isn’t the experience
        young people seek
        <br>
        <br>
        Office environment corresponding to today’s needs will greatly encourage people to use the office to improve collaboration and team morale - yet not require a heavy load of hours in office to permit the freedom of the full time employees to
        manage their working hours and contributions to the product
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="rant-header">BACKGROUND</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        A bit of background - I lived and worked on a farm during the summers as a kid. I believe blending work and family is the ancient and healthy way of life. Splitting families for work purposes is needed in war, but no other times in history.
        Lets stop the war. I don’t believe a work environment should discourage family presence, quite the opposite, the work place needs to be adjust to compliment the current state of workers lives. This product delivers tools to assist teams in
        adhering to these principals. I was offered terrific opportunities entering the workforce in Lincoln, and I don’t think the same opportunities exist today - especially with regard to the culture. I want women to participate fully if not
        equally in all areas of product development at all ages.
        The rate of innovation is forcing the gig economy - having people work for 2 or 4 hours at a time for only that pay has always been the corporations dream.
        This product is about developer and investor brains fighting back - like minds will draw to this product from both sides - the cost of smaller markets makes this “family raising team” possible. While applying this sort of manipulation long
        term to a product team doesn’t make sense, to encourage participation of both sexes at an entry level to participate in these types of companies, exceptional considerations are taken for a “short” ~5 year period. Most people care greatly
        about the social and aesthetic aspect of the workplace, especially early in their career.
        This product will be best consumed at the angel investment round ($3million + 5 year small team salary insurance, as the team grows the length of insurance decreases). Refer to company example, team make up, product description - while
        candidate company (or product team from a larger company) can be flexible, there are a workable number of companies that meet this limited criteria.

      <div class="rant-text">
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanisms to balance pay between male and female workers overall and individually (performance will be compared female to female, and male to male for purposes of pay, but the pool will be graded the same per rank per sex).</li>
          <li>Billing system can track flows (gender, partner company, gig work), quick payout</li>
          <li>Logo for display for meeting standards set by this plan (certification)</li>
          <li>Developer accounts effective at hiring contractors for gig work locally</li>
          <li>Require the participating companies to be located in a geographly small market to encourage in person interaction amongst workers</li>
          <li>Salary and employment insurance for employees new to the market (5 years minimum from a layoff)</li>
          <li>Considerable worksite benefits related to family and personal health, fitness and wellness. These are graded into the salary insurance pool as an overall cost.</li>
          <li>During pregnancy and other life occurances additional gig resources are made available to the employee and considerations are taken to keep the employee relevant (and current if possible) in the product development cycle first, feature productivity second. The additional gig resources are optionally under the guidance of the employee - but are probably managed by others on the team - managing additional gig resources isn’t easy. </li>
          <li>Shared resources in the market such as daycare, wifi, public spaces, pet friendly areas and other market spaces intended to promote free (funded) usage.</li>
          <li>Verifies employers and contractors live in the local area (or physically visit the market)</li>
          <li>If companies do not have integrated daycare or nearby daycare for all employees (contractor and otherwise), the Delicious companies will interact at a minimum - this extends to handicap accessible and other obvious culture crashers we don’t want. In other words an internal, but obvious and not so private black ball list.</li>

      <span class="rant-header">CONSIDERATIONS OF ENTRY LEVEL PEOPLE</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Extensive consideration is given to entry level contractors and the failings they will encounter. Instead of a permanent black marked record of failues, the system will implement forgiveness and all sides wil recognize the challenges of
        young people entering this market as entry level development contractor. People make a range of mistakes, this is about climbing and getting better, not profile history. Successful employer/contractor relationships come from iterations -
        sometimes those fail - we want to do all we can do soften the resistance to repeat work on both sides.
        Paying people to train and learn is a fact of life in the gig economy - this product tries to blend the willingness to do this with the desire to keep bucks and brains local.
        A 22 year old kid isn't going to know all the tech today to create an MVP "quick" ... but they can take the wheel just fine and make changes to a tight and new stack. In fact this is just what I would want to do...
        Brains do dumb stuff like screw around until bills pile up and they need quick payment. The national gig market caters to fast and up front payments to brains, and this system wants to make sure it caters the same to the local brains.
        Young professionals need to gain skills to actually contribute “work products” to teams. While this isn’t actually required for a company to succeed - but employees get satisfaction from actually contributing to the product in some way -
        even if minor. The skill doesn’t have to be elite - the point is to participate in the iterations to learn and grow the brain coverage on the product to introduce ongoing innovations. The “skill requirement” is to get “hands on” experience -
        but the actual contribution of the skill’s direct output to the work required per iteration is of minor importance at best. Some people have to get work done, but coding (or related ongoing changes to the product) isn’t the hard part -
        getting the right changes in the right places without resulting errors (brain coverage) is way more critical as the product gains a maturing audience.
        (blend following)
        Create an environment favorable to engineers first entering the workforce - the newest techniques, quality architecture and a fresh product and market to compete - without having to learn a number of historical languages, perform many one
        time complicated activities (done during MVP creation) and instead focus their engineering skills on mixing the newest tech features to make the newest product features in the respective market.
        This product is designed to attact and retain talent out of college (vs the strategy of hire it away) - utilizing experience only as needed from the remote gig economy and as possible from the local gig economy
        This is intended as an option in competition to a job early in a technology industry. The gig ecomony is utilized for experience and productivity and this mixes a co-ed environment to make a social business mix for tomorrows collaboraters.
        (blend following)
        My experience is while all male teams are easier to create and direct, over the long haul there isn’t as much cohesion and commitment, tends to get be some infighting for control, etc. Mixed teams seem more committed, although my experience
        is limited productivity from the female participants. I’m fine with females producing less (lazy / dumb dead weight is different).
        Moving forward line count won’t be as critical as brain space and contribution - so special considerations are worth it to fully include females in the product cycle. Trust me, this won’t be a problem with lead developers, cost it in, make
        it fair for the team / product (don’t kill us with too big a penalty).
        Eite developers carry teams. Wonder why they leave? Look at the team content. If you get a bunch of lazy ass middle aged dead weight - a carry will just go.
        Mix in some women and spirit and families - the developer doesn’t mind some carry here or there is it’s for more then a lazy old white guy at a desk.
        Also let the developer select the teams - althought co-ed manipulation is superior to picking the best of the best
        This product should encourage these teams to seek the highest talent females (delicious) - not just the cute ones - to make the teams most effective
        The Lincoln market can price this product in at this time and be nationally competitive

        The city built a ballpark. We'll finance the teams, buy the jerseys, supply the rent (pay) - just to see the game, and we want the game here in our park, so we can watch. This is what we can do and offer - is a situation like this. This is
        how we renew our culture.
        They have energy and new skills - but no broad experience
        They may also want to start a family and balance those interests
        Entry level person has weak contacts and needs to transition from college to professional
        1 - setup an MVP with b/leading edge techniques, scaled delivery, dev ops done, an iterative process/tracking sytem in progress
        2 - build the company, benefits, office and all of that for them. This is silly stuff that if done right, they’ll love, but where would they have time to do this, think about htis, etc etc
        (blend following)
        Gigs cater to older people with existing skills and little incentive to retrain
        Gig based professionals are limited in how many emerging technologies they can learn and also maintain stable income - if their current skill pays well their incentive to learn something else is low
        Entry level professionals with a limited skillset are hugely benefited where a local team with some personal guidance and instruction and return huge gains.should be the ones to learn the newest technologies and not bother with the older
        technologies.
        Elite experienced workers that are continuing to retrain on emerging technologies are the key “gig” assets to lead MVP teams - but their cost and age doesn’t cater to location in Lincoln and smaller markets with limited product creation. No
        matter where elite assets reside, chances are they cater to an international audience for the most enticing opportunities - this won’t change anytime soon. The use of these elite professionals to initialize products is as available to the
        Lincoln market as any other.
        (blend following)
        to encourage young women to participate in product cycle takes special care and attention - while women in their 30s and beyond swing stroke for stroke with male counter parts, the challenges on a female during the child bearing years are
        greater in my opinion. This product addresses a few of the major issues I see with the inbalance - pay, relevance to the product cycle (knowledge / ability to contribute) and flexibility to participate while living the desired and regular
        imbalance in child rearing responsibilities at a young age.
        A first class seat for people that under go the glorius and challenging in allways process of child bearing requires much more then just family leave to preserve them a fair and legitimate place in the process comparable to the skill and
        talent that they compared to people in their category

      <span class="rant-text">
        If you want a quality gig pool locally - you might want to take real good care of them. Brains like to climb at times and rest at others - lending to the nature of the gig environment. This product tries to help both edges - climb on skills
        and options and get a loan or scholarship to tide over a lazy or free floating brain.
        These are the kind of “soft” tools you need to function in a local gig market - where if you stop feeding work to someone - you can package a scholarship to train a new skill, etc. Developers have money and hearts - but it’s hard to be soft
        with gig based employees. Talented gig employees will at times need a lift to stay around the area, this tool hopes to bridge the gap without being too cute. It’s very much in deveopers interest to keep a talented pool of gig workers,
        companies do not compete on a product basis with other local companies anymore. For the most part, competing on employees is directly is pretty much over to.
        The worldwide gig market is a difficult soup - this is meant as a product to guild up locals to the outside reality of the market.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">COMMITMENT BETWEEN PRODUCT TEAM AND INVESTORS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        A five year commitment between investor and developers shows life commitment in addition to profit. Both investors and teams want to maintain quality relationships with all parties no matter the outcome of the product vehicles success.
        Developers and product people needs to stay relevant in their industry, as well as live a lifestyle that affords their familty the lifestyle they expect. An investor wants to promote team retention and lifestyle of employees, but needs to
        limit cost of risk in order to be effect investing. This product hopes to find a happy middle ground, in addition to reconizing additional market conditions to take advantage of.
        This product is tilted from the developers perspective. How much do we load him/her when s/he pays a contractor for bit work. What happens when s/he is in a low productivity period - where and how does team productivity get accounted for -
        whose brain does this etc. The price of these items is intended to flow from an insurance premium paid at time of investment (or scheduled payments, etc).
        The insurancer’s risk and costs are limited using pools and an arbitrator to make decisions. Only where the premium cost can be significantly reduced should insured risk be introduced into the coverage vehicles.
        The conditions moving forward will have one thing in common with the past - females with families prefer not to move. Chance are consistent product owners that retain teams in a local market will have female brains maintaining the product
        knowledge - best to develop these professionals here in this community.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">SUPPORT AND ENCHANCE THE LOCAL CASH FLOWS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Payment system optimized for local payments worker to worker (subbed projects) and certified employer to worker. The payment system tracks the gender rate of gig payments. The payment delivers cash (charged debit cards) to any local worker
        that stops in and certifies - and uses other forms of payment with minimal load (preferrably no load locally). Payment system when possibly pays instantly (same day) - and requires no direct interation between employer and worker (“cash”
        counter in one or more locations in market). Trusted gig workers can break up projects and tasks amongst themselves without the money taking a load as it’s transfered between workers. The payment system is focused on facilitating these
        collaborations and funded by the insurance product, not loads and fees. Where loads and fees make sense, they will be applied to transactions - probably due to cost per transaction external to the billing system.
        The billing, accounting, payroll, inventory and legal services provided free and subsidized are designed to remove the burden of delivering these services for small sized technology companies, but also assist in gather the needed gender
        based salary and gig distribution feedback to load the system. While combining this among a set of local technology companies using experienced local gig employees makes sense on it’s own, combining it with the mechanism to enforce gender
        based distribution of compensation for most participants to utilize all possible integrated business software. The usage of these features will be most required except in cases where the participant has sifficient ability to provide audit on
        compensation distributions.
        Risk and administration is very limited due to the direction of the top feeding of the employees - they select and flow the funds to gigs, so the risk is based on decisions of employees, fraud in the market is difficult to produce.

      <span class="rant-header">MARKET GUIDELINES / POLICIES / NORMS / EDUCATION</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        When a meeting includes an employee or contractor that requires daycare seat(s) - the expense is included in the meeting to secure space and make sure a baby sitting resource is included. This is always blended in the cost as required and
        not discussed as a load.
        A contractor is able to warn an employer of criminal and or financial history in order to prevent a collaboration at the business or social level the employer doesn’t prefer. This is intended to promote a business transaction but prevent a
        social one where a local person is happy to provide work to a challenged employee - but doesn’t seek the local personal/ongoing connection.
        While product focused brains are critical to innovate with industry level features if they are unavailable the market helps transfer gig based resources able to iterate the process to continue low level advancements (bug fixes, simple high
        productivity changes) (market protection for fellow companies - since similar skillsets no reason to let a revenue stream fall).
        Market level guidelines for gig workers - specifically confidentiality, creditionals, work product, notes on hours and fixed price work for invoicing - a how to. Specific companies and developers can attach additional notes about policy for
        their particular process.
        There are obstacles lthat remote work promotes that local work used to overcome - this is delays in humans doing things like creating authorizations in systems or taking time to screenshare and walk someone thru a process - in a real office
        someone would see someone stuck and help. This system wants to capture that local synergy in a digital way - in the spirit of local collaboraters that isn’t as important with remote workers - not the task itself - but the unblock other
        “friendly” workers to make sure their path is ok.
        Required short onboarding for both contractors and employers and agencies (split income alliances of contractors) - optional longer - this provides direction to “default” policies for the market - and the ability to “customize” the policy
        terms per company/contractor - and these “exceptions” to default policy show as flags when inspecting profiles, etc, and starting a new gig for the first time for both sides (before final agreement)
        Library of market techniques - these would be firebase, extended reality and other local specialties that are common amongst companies or a standard a local company wants to share to the market (and specify - optionally - a “best” practice
        method) - and these would include dates so people get respect of when they created a document - techniques age and tools change.
        After a certain level of income or number of jobs, a gig worker gets access to upper level white papers and training - and possible scholarships (for rewards for jobs complete)
        As brainsplicer is written develop tutorial, jira and other process documentation to base other companies on (software development step by step using the doc trail of brainsplicer MVP creation)
        Companies that have a hard time reforming payroll to meet standards could provide scholarships to female gig workers as an offset to promote better practice moving forward
        A scholarship can be used to attend one or more meetups (etc) related to a subject - good way to get these more co-ed oriented
        Explainer for contractors that the money they earn is 1099 and needs to have taxes removed and a brief estimate of a what a self employed person with no real business expenses should expect to deduct and pay in quarterly, and have the
        contractor “agree” to terms that they understand and have read. Make this a heavy click thru on the first onboarding - so it’s clear that we pay the money and it’s on them to do it right, we’ll help with tax tools and techniques - but once
        the 1099 money is paid it’s not our issue and there is no confusion.
        Additionally explain we don’t send 1099’s or our clients, it’s on the contractor to record (and we provide yearly history of earnings) earnings from each company and do their own taxes. This has nothing to do with us - we just transfer
        payments. Our clients companies are no longer required to send 1099 unless you do 200+ transactions.
        For shops that carry stock and / or can order stock, a collaborative store to help people in the market identify they can order products from the vendors in the market (and possibly have them delivered there as well) (API for voice search
        across the market) (Possibly limits on this so one vendor doesn’t dominate, or offer preferred listing at a cost, etc)
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">INSURANCE BENEFIT RELATED STUFF</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Life insurance makes a ton of sense here for employees out of college - relate it to a sports star with injury insurance in college. In this case an employee is insuring their career to protect their family, it’s a terrific twist of value on
        all sides.
        Guaranteed issue life for birth event - either gender
        Life insurance could be backed by the salary pool for decent amounts - with reinsurance as possible - where rated situations exist they are money purchase reinsured face adjusted to match salary level
        Living benefits (related to life insurance) - could be “guarantee” issued to some level vs the salary pool then reinsured using a salary level amount of money purchase additional coverage for each benefit
        In general where life events would compel the group to contribute to the aid of another, lets share risk and distribute benefits from the shared/guar salary pool
        Benefit deductions for gig based workers in system could be backed by “backed” loans - so that when they don’t have work / don’t work in the system, a loan kicks in to cover/guarantee the benefit for them - that results in a loan balance due
        when returning to the system - keeping the benefits in force.
        For contractors that have earned 10k or 20k or more per year qualify for guaranteed issue insurance benefits (optionally provided by 3rd party insurer and underwritten as such - no Delicious Company or Delicous Culture itself would be
        involved - the offer would be based off a partnership and use profile history of the person).
        Provides a package of UL and Living Benefits backed by a shared pool of risk at the market level
        Major illness, loss of family member, tragic life events are insured at additional payouts directly and also to replace lost employee contributions, keep the employee involved at some level.
        The teams should be mostly young, so this shouldn’t be a heavy load on overall pricing, but is most useful at this age if something does occur, for the “talent” we want, this is the right kind of thing to provide.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">MARKET GOODWILL / STABILITY MEASURES</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Goodwill mechanism built into pools to leave some value in the market (not excessive) to underwrite increasing longer “salary insurance” for new companies - not a penatly level - more a success bonus that pours into the pool for the next
        companies - so insured “burn-out” risk by health events is eliminated first, then “length” beyond 5 years is exteneded, the focus is to increase the pools resistance from health/life events to bust
        (Possible) Options where if one Delicious company goes big it pays in “some” additional to the pool if the pool has been damaged by other Delicious failures/salary/gig payout. This isn’t meant to payoff the Delicious company, but rather
        repair the local market specific pools if they’re been hurt (a thanks we made it gesture written in - but graded to be fair) The amount would be bsaed on the intial premium. This way one or more companies and the market can celebrate
        “rewarding” sucess with payback - and have it fair and understood what level works. The idea being a moderate sucess can be just as glorius for both as a huge success with respect to market “status”.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">FINANCIAL RELATED (BLEND SOMEWHERE)</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        (Possible) loan/scholarship status on skills / debt age listed on candidates for gigs and lists of contractors lfw
        Graded local rating - if verified in town within month 100% - otherwise within 3 months, within 1 year, as far as having been verified as in market (physical checkin - probably at least 2 separate months to be considered resident in market)
        Salaries for employees could be set with minimum level + a gender bucket - so that men and women know the gender bucket can quickly slide due to company employee changes
        When employee gender ratios are hard to match (either small or tilted for other reasons) - the pay ratio can either split the salary amongst the top ranked evenly (say 40% female, 40% all pay for top 10 of each gender) - or match most of the
        top slots (say male rank 1 vs female rank 1 50% split for the 2 salaries added up) - so that the pay is decent graded between gender, but when one or more male or female top ranked employees cause a strange offset a blending mechanisms to
        spread the evening over a few ranks - but still even the gender pay.
        A transfer between delicious companies (if friendly) could also include tenure - this is related where a company would spin off and back in - and the employees retain “tenure” related to retirement - in this case additional vestment of the
        company or payout funds in case of success could be transferred - the idea to capture overlapping skills if the product market is strong in one vs another - while providing enough reward for an important player to jump
        Team members are able to transfer gig account balances between them for favors - such as personal training - to offset the time lost by the training employee. Also if an employee is absent, and another employee is covering their feature
        work, the resources can be transferred to be used to support the work by the active employee.
        Today with budgets, investments, gig payouts, etc - employees know as much about the workings of the company as they do about the source code. Pay levels will be exposed to more people then regular to verify the pay (both gig and salary) is
        metered (rank and total) out as evenly as possibly between the sexes. Once the positions are hired, best as possible, the female employees will be ranked and pay will be graded amongst them such that the pot nearly evens the mens pots. In
        the case of an odd batch (3 v 2) - the top 2 in each will be matched, ranked and graded for pay. While adding or removing employees there will be a grace period, but once gender ratios are evened out with selective hiring, the previous
        imbalance in pay can be evened out with grading moving forward on a 3 month type of range for the scale. In the case of a female over balanced company, instead of paying the left over male employees more, the money can be slide into gig
        based programming, the intent of this system is not to scale up lessor skilled male based developer resources - and it’s unlikely this will be the case with grace periods to fill open positions. Arbitrator can make exception for a contractor
        or employee that is of special importance and rate or remove their salary from pool consideration.
        If a company becomes female heavy, gig based compensation benefits will grade down, but not salary penalties to offset the male income. The idea is to not penalize the pool for female related expenses more exceptionally heavy then needed.
        Female ratios: min count: 40%, min total salaries: 40, rank per class salary: 90% class to class
        Capped payouts on gig resource budgets and salary payouts (some per company and scaled per market reduce risk)
        Any money leftover in the salary pool after the 5 year period is converted in pay for the employees (either retirement or direct checks)
        Since the product is driven by the motive of the client companies, not the billing system, it should keep the loads out of the system - making money flow between parties many times without reducing
        From when I was young - the richest and most successful people didn’t look at how much they made per hour, they were always thinking about how to keep every dollar or grain they could in their eco-system. By getting the load of the local
        eco-system payments, it maintains a local feel that equates to handing someone cash directly. On the other hand, it also removes the trouble a developer would take to run out and deliver the cash - but due to the “nature” of not losing
        nutrients in the eco-system people resist payment systems, but then resist local transactions because of the trouble of a personal contact.

      <span class="rant-header">DESRIED PRODUCT VEHICLE</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        The company most likely will be formed from entry level engineers and the remaining product knowledge people from the MVP creation. The MVP engineers are likely gone at this juncture (or leaving). The MVP should be of elite design and
        implementation, including an iterative process in place to add features effectively. The team will iterate new features to maintain a market pace, starting with industry leading techniques, platforms and API's. This provides a small company
        team 5-10 people - mixing local salary/fulltime resources with local and remote gig resources, and local and remote clients to compete on a large stage with a focused presence. The skills and techniques initially trained/learned should last
        this period and not require a heavy reskilling. Development process removes trivial tasks off of the product team and either uses techniques and external products to meet those needs, or consumes gig resources. Trivial tasks can be
        considered as challenging but don’t require product specific knowledge and once complete the code or work done is a generic work product that can be utilized by the team at large and/or another gig resource.
        (blend this)
        This is a regular flow if you want a leading/bleeding edge product for your company - have an mvp person like me write it. It simple takes too long for your people with high product knowledge to learn the latest technology and figure out the
        most suitable tools to their task on an occasional basis. MVP teams spend massive time in learning technology - they prefer to spend time on implementing technology features - not product features that involve redundent coding (similar code
        is in the product already)..
        (end blend)
        Consider a product teams as 3-5 employees scaling to 10-15 over 5 years.
        Focus on Firebase, Javascript and Virtual Reality technologies are preferred.
        focus on product features and iterate in a target market.
        The vehicle owner can be one or more corporations that use the product.
        Form a team fresh out of college with seeking years of experience in a competitive but safe position
        Able to use experienced resources to accomplish a range tasks to save bandwidth/focus/energy for product related development
        Neptism is fine - teams with friends is fine, these are meant to be tight groups, and if people leave they do, we have pooled gig resources to help manage turnover
        Products that the developers can manage at their experience level - and produce industry noticable results - the idea being that talent plays to an audience, and they need a chance to make plays (features that count)
        Existing large companies may create a new product team in a vehicle for 5 years to focus on a new version of a product with a new code base and new techniques to replace an existing product or a migration with breaking business changes. The
        concept then converts to finding measurable goals and incentives for the team to iterate/evolve the product into a profitable industry tool for the company.
        The team/vehicle that administers this plan in a specific market can be setup as one of the teams - removing the arbitration roles into a local respected player (bank or insurer preferred) - the team would then be able to generate synergy
        with other teams - possibly hosting some of the core workplace assets - such as during the week / during the day available “spot” daycare, cash desk, gig worker hangout while doing scholarships and searching for work while using loans (not
        required, but doesn’t hurt to come and see others).
        Feature based development - where features can be implemented without the intervention of a lead developer to merge and deploy changes - this caters strongly to gig based workers (this isn’t suggesting remove a top brain - but set up
        architecture to allow features - not just UI components - to be encapsulated and handled by a single developer (or group) start to finish that doesn’t require a single point (person) to close.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">SPONSORED LOCATIONS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        - where coffee is free and wifi is free - intended for people moving around locations that need to stop in for 15 minutes but don’t want to spend 10$ each time. So a Delicious location is sponsored and promotes employees
        and contractors to stop and use wifi without buying anything. This keeps things fast - don’t have to wait and buy and all that just to sit down for a few. Also people do want to contribute to the spaces they use, etc, so this is a win-win.
        The theme here is a Delicious “person” needs to be able to show they are - not to be elite - but to show they’ve “paid” for their place in the location by being a member (no one wants to free load). Possibly a daily multi-location pass - and
        each location gets credit that you visited - so a base payout to a location to play, and then bonus pay for visits.
        Market level benefits (like free coffee, wifi, shared daycare) - could be extended to non participants (either indvidual or companies). This makes a lot of sense with shared/sponsored locations, less so with daycare - it would a market by
        market blend.
        Non food stores can participate by providing an area to work - tables, etc - similar to the coffee shop inside barnes and noble. Normally a contractor would feel strange stopping in a small shop - but this is a win-win - a small shop wants
        traffic - and a contractor will like a non coffee shop setting as something very different. These should be kid friendly - and need a good reason if not. They would get a small reward by participating, but could also offer some other service
        like hair care, etc etc.
        Optionally locations can be pet friendly. This is obviously difficult, but desired by many.
        A general theme of the market is to make spaces flexible and usable by many - so we get a compression of people and activity in a smaller area - more eyes watching the store fronts. And we want “qualified” people (not vagrants) moving
        between locations with ease and comfort
        Market wide wifi for qualified people - also have it easy to use everywhere - not a different login places so people can move easily and quickly
        Handicap assisted zone - while all market places should be handicap accessable - designate a part where it’s most easy to enter the market and make sure the nearby locations are the most equipped to support handicapped people (wheelchair,
        seeing eye dog and otherwise). This during the day might include a guide or helper to assist and make sure the resources are delivered best. The idea being the restroom and other personal facalities are catered to disabled in this area - not
        just accessible. The market could designate this area and provide additional money to support this. The facilities should cater to include handicap people as much as possible in the technology experience - including large screens and other
        handicap related technogly interfaces. Also private and regulated spaces - some of these people don’t get out often and these visits might be about access to technology and / or small groups - not a public/social purpose.
        On duty guard available to escort females through parts of the market to enter and exit the market at all hours - this is especially important at night to have escort in lonely/vacant and dark parts of the market.
        This plan isn’t intended to chase out vagrants and weirdos - at the same time it’s meant to encourage free flow and participation in the shops and locations in the market for qualified people. It’s intended to use resources to enable the
        pace of remote work to match local collaboration - online - you open skype and start the meeting, in a market you head to a location and buy something, configure the wifi, find a table, look for the others, make sure you have some privacy if
        you need it, etc. There is more to do, we want to make that easier because people want to do this - but it’s expensive versus other non personal options.
        This is for markets that have large available spaces - Delicious will support shared usage of this space which encourages people to stop in shops and provides lots of spots for gig and other workers to hangout.
        Participating locations and shops in the market can offer virtual appliances and other extended reality retail location specific information
        The idea here is that traffic (people stopping in) alone will drive revenue - not just sales - promotes having a neat display of stuff - even if it doesn’t sell there - people visit and all sides win.
        Market Wide (optional) POS system with minimal load - so people can search across the market and order on their phone, walk to the location to pick up the item with no cash, etc.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">MINIMUM PREMIUM TO INITIALIZE PRODUCT (theory)</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        ~5 companies @ $25mill total investment (so if 50% load ~ $8 million in loaded premium)
        Companies in a specific market enter into a guaranty for salary insurance.
        Or some multiple of this for the initial release to cover the expense of the billing system, and setup of payout systems, admin systems, etc - while many existing products and systems would be combined - the gig market to cash system is
        likely to need to be custom to work well.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">MARKETING TARGET</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        The selection of the product will likely be directed by the people with the mostly ability to make choices - lead developers of applications and products. The marketing discussion is aimed as such. There is a second party participating in
        the decision - the investor - but their decision will rest on the utility of retention and talent to this particular product.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">LENGTH OF OFFER FOR EMPLOYEE (RETAIN VALUE TO INVESTOR)</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        by offering reliable employment when entering the workforce, taking into account a life balance that includes retension and revelance over production of the individual. These opportunities are “salary insured” for ~ 5 years - this should
        allow enough income consistency to raise a family.
        Provide “Turnover” insurance pool to use gig resources if experience a high rate of turnover to keep product viable - these would large cost/penalty to make sure the product is relevant if the team leaves and needs refreshed
        Investors seek a soft shutdown with a team so they can keep the collaboration - when it’s apparent a product won’t be viable, the investor is best served with a complete halt - but doesn’t want to kill the team. This offers a fair and softer
        option for both sides.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">WHY MANIPULATE MARKET</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Technology is advancing in such a way that it makes product, software and branding work easier to reuse across cultures and markets - the misbalances in cost require adjustments in higher income markets to effectively compete
        This is a different age, people aren’t going to work as much or as long, but I believe when they do work, they’re going to work hard and for reasons other money alone
        People (esp female) who play should get a first class seat on the bus - not get demoted in rank for it.
        The idea here is since pricing in local markets aren’t even market to market anyways, lets set some rules for the local market to introduce some culture in this product feature race (which is national).
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Fees and loads are avoided at all costs in this product - for two reasons. One they cause avoidance of the system if money is lost from the eco system from transfers. Secondly - fees and loads represent the cost of a Delicious employee or
        insurance employee performing a real activity - we want to automate those or design away from those. If a service is desired that requires human or capital resources per usage - a fee is required and makes sense in order to deliver a service
        to clients at scale.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">KISS COMPANY FOCUS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Small simple companies/teams meant to compete feature by feature in a market for several years to gain an established foothold (an emerging market). Once these market mature, the talent is no longer well applied, as the ability to innovate
        and create revenue changing features becomes more limited.
        This is a "developer" focused structure - where the company and it's rewards - short, middle and long term, are entirely focused on catering to the "product development" team - which is usually talent heavy in the programmer area - but
        almost always includes key people with knowledge in other areas.

      <span class="rant-header">TIGHT CONTROL OF TEAM MAKEUP vs PRODUCT</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        I'll hand mesh these with "very" young people to seed this "soup" - I want people to see in Lincoln that you can be 19 and go for it and kick ass. I'll play some games to spice stuff up - but hey that's how it's done on the coasts too.

      <span class="rant-header">DAYCARE PROVISIONS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        for short stop ins or all day
        onsite or near by supplimented (if not totally free) daycare - all normal hours
        if you stop in to work, you have support to monitor your family
        Not intended as group funding of daycare, but if your work/life balance doesn’t include anymore daycare then needed with respect to your product development role, these options should match up to that
        certain level of funds and company policy attributed

      <span class="rant-header">MVP SALE PROVISIONS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        -- Product/team receives investment for multiple years
        -- MVP lead and key developers leaving (nationally speciallized remote resources as the quality of product implemntation dictates) (high priced experienced tech focused talent moves to next mvp project)
        -- product knowledge people will stay (likely)
        -- entry level talent can begin working on product features immediately and compete in an evolving market (where adding new features has liklihood of adding users/revenue)
        -- the incoming team will be the one to select/utliize the Delicious product
        -- allows entry level talent to use the newest techniques without learning all of the underlying architecture and deploy setup that veteran programmers can initalize in the MVP - including selecting the best technologies - entry level talent
        can’t be expected to well at this
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">SALES TEAM AND DECISION MAKERS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Incoming team, deck pitching insurance salesman and investor make the decision to apply Delicious product. It would be applied as a heavy load on entire investment (with investment applied to salaries and rent, etc - adjusted for other non
        labor costs) - 50% - 100% is desired range. For example a $2million dollar investment for a 3 year product team - add Delicious and make it $3 mill.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">MOMENT OF SALE DETAILS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        investors want to do "good" things
        this is a "treat" the team well product.
        Industry specific "demands" can be made - such as sabotical time to volunteer to related causes that need scientific expertise
        Worksite salesman can deliver a range of options to compliment the Delicious package, but it’s only Delicious with certain minimum requirements - the saleman could pitch other than packages with Delicious - it’s in all parties interest to
        all him to act directly in the startup/client/investor interest freely to make the project happen.
        Pricing for a 5 year team in a small year market is 2 million, or say 4 million (max worst case if no revenue these numbers represent - total lost) - this insurance can be priced in on a market comparison of price basis.
        Gives the investor the ability/option to “seed” some corporate culture - the high cost will represent the cost of all parties to the endeaver
        but the commission isn't "wrong" - the agent is paid based on product sold, not as a % of the startup - takes away an economic gain for the agent on a large startup (which hurts the company by taking it's opening money). This would probably
        be in the form of a % of invenstment incoming or % of company - or both, to do this type of pitch and hit.
        The insurance product produces a more reasonable middle layer - with decent incentive to get sales based worksite people into the startup market helping them scheme business operations (not product development) - which is what these guys do
        - the worksite agents are more like business consultants then these local agents - and they make a sizable amoutn more
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS LOGO</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        - "adheres to Delicious Standards™"
        - meets the standards in addition to the worksite product on a per market basis
        like "Delicicious Culture" as a logo they show as a partner - with an incentive to partner/use other Delicious companies - as we can track the flow of resources to females to credit them for hours/money attributed to females, that are also
        backed with pregnancy insurance.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">LEGAL EXPENSE PREVENTION</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Since the product team is formed at a specific time, a business vehicle (corporation preferred) is also formed at the same time - with the ability to encode Delicious Standards into the charter. -- "adheres to Delicious Standards(tm)" in the
        charter. Require that level of commitment, where we (the group insurer) enter in arbitration with an upper hand and the court system is out. These standards will have monetary caps in terms of payouts and penalties - so exclusive arbitration
        is reasonable in this case.
        Option if reasonable to roll corporation into mutual if independant (can buy itself out from original investment)
        the salary guarantee and other worksite “pool” funds left over from the insured period roll into a mix of stock/mutual/private employee directed vehicles (including direct payout to the employees as cash).
        The charter and initial requirements would last only for the first 5 years, but the tag can be retained permeantly after
        vesting formula of funds and stock: focus on the early employees having more weight - balanced with significance to stay relevant (typical formula for balancing bonus, etc).
        Take greed out of the venture for the funding and put the power and risk to the teams to scale the company revenue / user base
        If the company pays off the guarantee - they’re totally independant (option for ideal situation - where they are a subsidairy and/or the original investor requires some type of hold this is waived)
        Final Arbitrator is a person local to the specific market with vested interest in town, but required to act only in exceptional situations in this role
        Left over gig money is directed towards charity or paid out to a local gig collaborator (i.e. FUSE) as a suppliment to continue gig related support
        These young kids are going to do a lot of stupid things. They’ll sue the parent companies, they’ll make mistakes, they’ll make bad choices. Lets keep their focus on the product iterations, not all of this other noise (corporate ground game).
        This “corporate ground game” is the same old stuff, lets manipulate the environment to leave this stuff off the product development teams. Let the good old people do this work.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">REALISTIC WORK WEEK MOVING FORWARD</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        people wont work 40 hrs per week every week anymore, so having a child while flexing in product (hard) dev work is possible - and much of this work is probably done at home or a preferred location. While a good amount of office time is
        expected, think of the office as more of college professor usage not old school clock it for 40.
        The office is meant to be of high value to local gig based employees collaborating with the team. The amount of shared benefits (i.e. daycare, etc) is outside the scope of this product for gig workers. Only gender/partner company/location
        are monitored.
        People won't work as hard going forward ... just don't have too, it's an easier world. Expect to get less from paying more, but consider team composition for the middle to longer term.
        Many people exiting college are planning to put off marriage longer, have kids while single - including a variety of non traditional situations. This plan is intended to cover those people as well.

      <span class="rant-header">ADDITIONAL SERVICES</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        "collaboration structure" or "collaboration framework" to pool the retainer on quality resources but no the variable costs
        Trademark, patent protection, ISBN submission, business process, accounting, payroll, business to business billing, having “typical” solutions ready to go so the developers can focus on their product
        Pool common things, like parking in an area (if gig and market suppliment dictates an area).
        These resources are available for the first 5 year period - after which individual private (regular business) contracts can be reached.
        Documents related to tax filings, client/company confidentiality exampe agreements - sure this isn’t leading edge stuff - it’s all stuff the gig ecomony can supply in a quality way from older gig workers
        The intent is to provide the quality business presentation that old fashioned businesses work well with and mix it with the electronic and instant pace of the gig economy.

      <span class="rant-header">TEAM LEASE/REUSE IF PRODUCT TERMINATED</span>

        Provide options to sell the team if product is no longer viable or the team’s value is better served on another project
        If a team is not able to find another project, employees will be promoted internal to the network
        Worst case the salary guaranty is executed until they find a similar job, but with the preference they participate in the local gig market as possibly while also receiving insurance
        All other pool benefits would remain for the 5 year period as possible

        Aggressive and “aesthetic” teams appeal to higher class investors who place faith in a mix of class and talent
        Some rich younger people want to participate now and then in a team environment, but due to their position in life aren’t motivated to work hard. But they are attacted to quality teams, and Delicious teams will have talent and work on fun
        projects - but at a higher cost (these vehicles are for a higher class of investor that intends to succeed and desires creating and retaining a quality team in their collaboration network over a quick fire foreign team.
        High income/population environments are examples of poeple looking to be involved in the technology and the startup economy, but their local environment in no way caters to the type of focus required to do well in this situation. Lets share.
        We'll build a set of race cars (already made MVPs) they can "buy" and play with on "5 year" min contracts (with options to sell the team should the product fail, or buyout possibly, we'll see).
        The focus being not only do they have a cool tech, american team, but they also used “delicious” to make sure they have a cool team (one they can visit and actually work with … it’s that kind of thing they could actually visit - a real one).

      <span class="rant-header">WORKFLOWS IN THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ECONOMY</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Workflows today involving difficult topics use a variety of digitial tools to communicate - and are superior to classic verbal meetings. While some in person scheming is certainly the intent of the office workplace, encounters requiring
        challenging meetings are a thing of ths past - challenging (complex) topics are best assisted with digital tools so people can review. The opportunity to socialize and intermix is a key feature of the office place for mostly remote IT
        workers - including others friends and family (as they visit in tow).
        Additionally for new technology boundary pushing companies - this product looks to deliver expert level tools for payments (especially gigs) and billing that encourage best practices for business today. Brains need to focus on their specific
        technology, not spend time on general business practices - that while being good at these does matter a lot, it’s not the right place to spend product brains.
        Activity in the local gig market must take into consideration the conditions in the remote market for both sides. Many times it makes sense for either side to utilize remote - but from my experience both sides prefer to use local - it’s just
        very hard to do. Rather then “change” habits - this product considers the conditions of the local gig market over the remote market. The remote gig market is very well served, and competing wtih upwork isn’t in the scope of this payment
        product.
        Possible matching role - while headhunters rarely actually know what people can do, asking one local gig worker which other gig worker can do tasks is probably a lot more valuable and should be blended in. While friends recommend friends,
        this generally isn’t a bad thing, programmers also will usually give you a fair take on what/who you need.
        The gig economy holds a lot of potential for instantly available technology skills to create functionality, on the downside there is a lot less ownership on projects, making project owners more important and stretched then ever. Time to
        deliver for MVP or iterative product features is as critical as keeping costs down - the gig economy can help with these needs. Can is the key word - with these positive results eluding most teams. Understanding that talented gig workers
        want new challenges and to climb and to find these climbers and work with them produces the best results. The people looking to farm an existing skill until it wears out without reskilling aren’t likely to be the closedown/integration type
        of programmers you need to finish projects and features.

      <span class="rant-text">
        As a community, succeed or fail, the experience gained at an early age is very valuable to professionals - of both sexes. This permeates all phases of life, and this product allows a community to place high value on experiences to both sexes
        as much as direct contributions to product feature log. Contributions to the product features are still highly valued and focused, but the physical considersations of pregnancy and challenges of early professional careers are not the same
        for both sexes, and this product applies a balancing effect with insurance products and vehicles to pay even based on sex considering these differences, but beyond, also consider the experience and expertise, and also level those out. The
        ownus is on the male developers to specify this as requirement in companies they drive.

      <span class="rant-header">COMMON EXISTING TEAMS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        While all male teams move faster to start with - my personal experience is the talent at some point leaves and you end up with a pile of white middle aged lazy ass dudes that don’t do anything. This is where you have a lot of money and hire
        in some talent, that then cycles out again. The technology that is common to the team ages, it’s hard to get talent at all or gain new techniques to advance. These product grind to a halt many times.

      <span class="rant-header">PREVIOUS SOLUTIONS TO RETAIN TALENT</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        The first idea is to have the developer hire the team. Well a guy hiring girls has happened a lot. The companies did work sometimes, but didn’t a lot. Pay them more is a common idea - problem is they get fat and spend much more time on the
        life side of the work/life balance that doesn’t help the team. Hire fluff and wellness support employees to tell they’re fat and make them feel bad so they work harder (weight - this actually retains people?)...

      <span class="rant-header">MEDIUM LENGTH PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (OLD! - BLEND)</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        This product is a high cost - high reward product geared towards enabling young women to enter the professional market in product and application development - while maintaining their preferred physical life. While women (recent college
        graduates) are not expected to contribute consistently as much as male counterparts, the product is aimed at keeping them up to speed on the team when a pregnancy or other health or family related event is occuring. The gig based economy is
        used as a key component to suppliment female workers as heavily as possible during family events - males do not require the physical and metal stresses of child bearing, this product is meant to even the playing field - encourage young
        ladies to enter the intense product development (startup) environment - but not get left behind because of physical events. Recent college graduates that want to bear children are put first - but the rate of product development is also
        considered. Including young ladies on entry level - but talented teams on paper appears to only incur expense - high expense to make it worthwhile for the women to participate (to fall behind due to childbirth is a huge barrier to entry in
        this line of work at this age). Considersations of how to deliver this product and who would choose and pay the “load” on this product is included.

      <span class="rant-header">SOFTWARE FEATURES (BLEND SOMEWHERE)</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Integrate timeclock feature - not sure it’s quite like upwork - but make it easy to invoice hours, track hours on fixed projects (for reference) and show online/available status.
        Time tracking possibly - maybe just guidelines/suggestions on how to invoice and track time - for both contract and fulltime employees - with the flexible and many times remote environment invoicing is a very important form of communication
        - not just for biling - but for sizing the next feature and iteration for cost and time
        REST API so client companies and contractors can integrate gigs and payments, etc into their own systems
        Allows for loose local collectives where one person is the communicator with client and others bill work hours on a gig - but they don’t have to form a partnership, etc local to bill, the system cleans this up for them until they want to do
        it themselves
        Creditionals storage for companies - and a trust level verified for local contractors so that logging in and pulling source for local companies happens quickly and without trouble (or documents, etc etc - that are confidential and behind
        security access). Options to store creditionals and or OAuth login support to systems, etc.
        Tightly integrate existing project management systems (JIRA/trello/github, etc) - with JIRA first to make it easy to link and navigate between systems and reference related technique documentation
        Option by employer or contractor to filter themselves from the others results for gigs or contractor searches
        Employer contacting contractor can remain anonymous until otherwise
        Allow gig workers and employers to specify how much personal/social interaction they prefer during and after small jobs. Many contractors don’t want to do local work and be someones little helper - so they would prefer to remain anon. Same
        with employers, they may spend a few hundred to do things on someone they don’t want an ongoing personal connection to. If people specify this upfront and clearly, it should provide a lot of utility to the relationship and matching. This
        isn’t intended for devious tasks - all transactions will be highly visible - with direct business value not that important - the gig money is equivalent to salary from the business salary pool.
        Use common billing system in a market for ease of local gig resource consumption
        Accounts are quick payout via upwork, paypal and other services so contractors can be paid instantly when needed

      <span class="rant-header">VIRTUAL REALITY, AUDIO AND VIDEO RELATED SOFTWARE FEATURES</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Integrated video and audio features for gigs - where a file can be included, screen shots, times, comments, designed to make it easy to pass these items with comments back and forth for edits
        3D / extended reality calendar to view gig gant chart etc
        Digital (esp 3d / model / texture / scene) transfer easily to view and relate to contracts. While JIRA, etc has a range of features (easy to include a link) - the idea here is to have a model/avatar viewer to make it easy to see 3D assets
        that were create by a gig worker on contracts. (work history type of thing for 3d stuffs - integrated into system).
        Model/avatar markup system so it’s easy to include the model, make notes and pass changes back and forth in the system, including bids, etc.
        While some embedded documentation makes sense, this isn’t the focus of the app - there is a ton of that stuff that exists. The 3D specialization is different, that’s a distinction based feature(s).
        By having 3D specialized features - we allow anonymous contracts to be possible for a large number of content editing tasks - while not required - the employees may not want to know who is doing the content work …. really.
        Shared Conference tool to visit scenes and view models and textures that both developer and client share state real time
        ***Integrated 3D features (webgl) - including shared conference, 3d reporting visuals to show projects/contractors and other items for matching up gender requirements / other 3d options as possible

      <span class="rant-header">MARKET READY TECHNICAL SUPPORT</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Because teams located in a specific Delicious Market(™) can be guaranteed hours immediately upon hiring for training and collaborating with new team members to ramp them up on the process as well as specific techniques while adding new
        features for the first few product iterations. The process, timing and expectations of features and complexity will be transferred as team starts out with a certain “flow” (rate of work expectation). Even if they fall below this standard
        short term, they will have collaborated previously in such a flow.
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">GIG MARKET DETAILS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        In order to create a local “free trade / cash pay out / pay in” zone, the local market could create a sub market for a few “companies” to exist to wash these payments external to the system at the minimum rate the market would allow. These
        companies will come under tax and criminal scrutiny, both national, local and international and at times will need to go out of business. The scheme is to have a flow of these that can continue this local pipe - this will be on the specific
        market to create these.
        Internal employee transfer/trade/employee choice migrate to another delicious company is preferred (the salary pool and other benefits could be graded/retained with respect to favor this)
        Technologies to be studyied could also be funded by outside sources, i.e. Firebase, WebGL (GC companies), LUIS (MS), etc - to keep gig workers refreshing skills companies will need.
        The only people placing/paying gig opportunities are vetted local employers - removing offers involving anything unrelated to work - while daycare and personal assist services could be possible, these would still be thru a company to assist
        a professional person - nothing in a personal nature would flow thru this system, this is intended directly for gig work to support business operations.
        Where possible the system should provide anonymity between the client and contractor - the client isn’t obligated to hire again or has any control over the contractor, etc. Keep it local, remove the personal by default (when preferred).
        Internal system profiles about gig workers - amount earned / job success, etc like upwork - so loans and grants can use this info in consideration (work history) - this info anon as possible
        Church and charity as targets of gig payments an option (market specific/ company specific)
        Verified Local, Verified Female - actual physical location in market where somone can get certified (without id) and receive cash or a debit card able to be charged (similar) plasma for direct pay. Contractors are required to periodically
        stop in to verify they are local.
        Tracking system used to load gig resources used via gender/location, etc to encourage preferred usage
        Non Delicious Companies can participate as companies/agencies in the market place under identical conditions or favorable. Tracking of categories of payments is preferred to receive the same benefits - but would not be worth the loss of
        excluding any entity in the local or external market wanting to do business in the local gig economy.
        Any non male gender is considered female for payout purposes, male for payment tagging (credit)
        In general salary insurance in addition means “most” benefits retention as possible included
        Employers can privately mark favored contractors (then who can be earmarked / uppicked for grants/loans, etc)
        Female (pregnancy age) skill specialization and gig/contractors given scholarships to train to have overlap for the specific skillsets (not product knowledge)
        The gig market will only emphasize employment history where it makes sense - this isn’t upwork - this is about handing out gigs locally over job history - we want to give the locals the 2nd and 3rd chance to succeed, not let a small gig
        failure (2-500$) dent their chance to do more gigs and climb into a skillset that can land them a full job.
        Local “can be available queue” - most gig workers can work on one or more projects at a time, with the ability to switch on their preference. I think most gig workers and people hiring gigs would prefer local - and if given the chance delay
        remote work to perform local work now. I would have a queue where a gig work can say “full avail” - “busy but avail local” - so a local gig hiring can select a contractor that is ok that is totall open, or select a contractor that is busy
        local but would shift things in leiu of going to the remote non-local market.
        The challenges to administering a plan like this are significant - but also remember the burdens of working with the people in the local market are best suited to a local player.
        Local market can flag a remote resource (say in upwork) that was ok to work with - so more work in the same more may lead to location here
        Market Specific Gift Cards that local vendors can be used to payout gig earnings on - including a bonus for putting it on the card (so it’s used in the loca market related to this product) ~10% or 20% like 200$ gift card with a bump up on it
        - or possibly this is the “unloaded” cash payout form - a market limited gift card that would have some cash value (possibly load it if converted to cash)
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">LOCAL GIG SCHEDULING</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Both employers and contractors can “warn” of upcoming projects (and availability) and related skills
        Both sides can do a commit of different levels (we have work next month, probably, contact us plz, etc - levels of commitment).
        This isn’t a crack down tool on closing projects, this is to help local people see ahead - but keep their options open
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">LOCAL GIG JOB MARKET</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        The gig economy is a reality. The gig economy and it’s ability to mix teams and assets and resources and deliver unique products prove it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.
        Local companies can utilize the gig market to develop local resources (sharing technique and developing talent directly)
        developer/product people would be given weekly budgets of ~20% of their salary or more to spend on gig work related to personal tasks - in addtion to directing gig resources in a regular flow
        For local work that can be performed anonymously and paid as such between parties, the billing software should allow this if the market chooses - removing personal barriers to bit work and simple tasks that don’t require a peronsal
        connection - but the money remains local
        A “gig/contractor” free-trade zone - where local money between parties is largely a form of cash (direct unloaded/controlled payment) - and is tax free and load free …. Create this “pipeline” market by market; putting loads into this pipe is
        complete stupid - no market will want to do it.
        Employers can tag jobs as 2 workers or more, and split male/female positions on a task to facilitate metering of hours on a gender basis
      </span>

      <span class="rant-header">LOCAL GIG WORKERS</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        Weekly or monthly unused gig money can dump into a pool to back loans to gig workers
        This entire system is friendly towards immigrants (others outside legal system)
        Personal information is exposed only as needed per contractor - things such as work history, loan repayment, job success %, amount earned are shown as needed to encourage lending and job reception - but not as a personal info respository
        This system/product is a work market - not a chat history or personal performance history on a quarterly or yearly basis there should be a rolling loss of history - so in total nothing older then 6 months is in the system. This is not a
        local knowledge repository - and it must not be - upwork is controlling too much information related to all projects in the world. While we may supply some dispute resolution - it’s not aimed at - and it’s not a market professional/personal
        research tool. Regularly dumping information and retaining history for a “fixed’ windows helps ensure all parties of such.
        Gig workers that have done successful work previously are general very honest people - making quality candidates for scholarships and loans (without verification). A 4 or 8 hr scholarship/grant/loan to study a skill could just be “taken” -
        but it’s likely if they’re not doing anything else, they’ll study that stuff.
        A gig worker could take a 3 month sabotical from one Delicious company to do a gig at another Delicious company - say implement a new api or technique
        In the system a gig worker can flag if seeking permanent position, scholarships requested during downtime - also an employer can tag a gig worker for a scholarship that becomes available when they are idle - not intended as upwork - instead
        a “local status” - scholarship request should be pretty rare when they can’t find local or remote work - or based on scholarships offered by a local employer to prime the gig market with skills
        Notes by the employer specific to company, market and contractor - and vice-versa for communication private or less private (the arbitrator can limit or time destroy - while we want profile history - this is also local and it’s best if a
        brain finds a workable local opportunity).
        Ability for employers to flag specific skills were use weak/ok/strong after a project (possibly employer only level view - not sure this should be hidden from contractors - one employer will at some point expose this info - while we can
        control exposure some - it will regularly be exposed.

        <span class="rant-header">PAYMENTS, LOANS AND SCHOLARSHIPS PAYOUTS AND PAYINS</span>
        <span class="rant-text">
          The payment system should provide a cash outlet locally that people can get paid cash immediately for gig work when the developer selects that option. Check or cash payment delivery similar to that of the plasma donation outlets. (they
          have
          a debit card they give people) - the idea is to support people without identification that need money (aliens, crooks, people that can’t use the banking system).
          A focus of this plan is to deliver local money as unloaded as possible paid out to the local contractors including cash payments
          While loads and fees will exist on the financial models, the costs will be blended into the premium paid by the product development firms. The will be caps to prevent abuse, but this market should not be that high of volume either in
          transaction count or amount.

        <span class="rant-header">PAYMENT SYSTEM</span>
        <span class="rant-text">
          Billing system and market collaboration software would piggy back off existing quality software to reduce cost, the main feature is tagging payments and salaries for gender and some other categories to a lessor extent
          Billing system makes it easy to track, pay and account gig work paid out (hours and fixed)
          Billing system in general caters to the ad hoc and instant paced gig economy
          Integrate Upwork / either in software or process (software preferred)
        </span>

        <span class="rant-header">MARKET SPECIALIZATION</span>
        <span class="rant-text">
          specialize (with confidence they can get selected over a national resource), and "compete" at a market level
          upwork already provides highlighted and first rank in job search results for local jobs
          technologies like Firebase, 3D modeling and Javascript should be focused, as these are in international demand now and for sometime to come
        </span>

        <span class="rant-header">PAYMENT AND BILLING SERVICES</span>
        <span class="rant-text">
          One key to the gig based economy is instant payment. Gig based employees screw around do whatever they want until they really need some money (like rent, or beer or drugs, literally … something small will motivate them to work for a day or a
          few to pay rent). The ability to deliver instant payments to gig employees is huge - they have past due rent, all kinds of needs that quick pay works. The developers on the team need a way to pay instantly as a more competitive advantage in
          selecting gig based employees over quantity! With intimate knowledge of the gig economy this product can incorporate a billing system that in addition to providing monitoring the flows by category, it can also respond to the unique
          challenges by iterating and evolving as a technical feature of the product. While not a requirement to use the billing system, the idea is it’s a key feature of this overall package.
        </span>

        <span class="rant-header">BANKING MARKET</span>
        <span class="rant-text">
          Companies in local market can sponsor the bank to make loans specific to certain technologies, but remain anonymous as the source of the support - and the bank will select which contractors get supported education loans or grants to
          educate
          (this removes the expectation the sponsored training leads to paid work, but allows the employer to contribute to the local skills market with influence).
          Bankers from local or national lending institutions are vetted and only certain lenders are given status to view additional personal informaiton on loan candidates - approved by local market arbitrator
          The ability to anonymously seed/grant/loan money for specific skills allows them to fund specific training for local assets in case they need them so they can hire local, if they’re not needed, hopefully it’s a useful skill and the
          contractor is useful in the market elsewhere or nationally more viable personally
          Include local banks in software to provide short term loans to software users, especially gig workers - the loans can be backed by employers (training) or local bankers can accept the bank risk based on work history (these are consider
          training loans - develop a skill during down time, or take a risk and study a new skill to level income).
          Loans are submitted into a queue and all banks are able to look at the loan and either request more information, offer to accept or pass - rather then the loan submitted to a specific bank to be directly rejected - this allows gig workers
          to
          request small amounts of money for various items without getting directly rejected by lenders (remove the personal interaction in the local lending process - but the local lender makes the choices via the system)
          Loan and grant performance history - were jobs taken for the skill after grants and loans, jobs at all?
          A local lender can participate to build up history with gig workers who may have a difficult time otherwise building up credit and reputation to receive a home loan. Local banks make loans to difficult cases when they know enough
          conditions,
          this is a place to help.
          A feature where an employer can flag a contractor to be notified if s/he requests a loan - which then could be backed (either anonymously or with attribution).

        This is by no means to avoid acquiring talent - quite the opposite
        Emerging talent should get "just the skills they need" and work on features and competing in a market place, not figuring out what people did before them and how to slightly advance....

        stay at the very edge

        these teams is a vested interest in acquiring and retaining knowledge on a specific industry and software package. Customer support isn’t just answering phones.

      <span class="rant-header">WHY NOT ONE TEAM</span>
      <span class="rant-text">
        For the MVP team, value current skills over retention, in fact, combining the two might be too expensive to consider unless it’s a principal player. Don’t commit principal interest to these developers - they’re unlikely to stay anyways

        For one, we only finish projects. If a project is longer then a few months and you’re not personally vested, etc, then a certain phase or segment. The idea is here, we will bargain in training and payback with each segment. For example,
        there is an interface in angular 4, and the backend is firebase. You know firebase, but are a react guy. We’d budget in for you to learn angular, but at the same time we’d expect you to put in extra time to keep a professional schedule for
        us and a quality product (through and through - not just the css layer).
        So we’re committed to helping you acquire skills, but at the same time, we’re comitted to you using them for all of us to make money.
        So why the hell would you leave if we win all the time (and we do)? Well we pay what we can. There are companies that will pay much much more, especially once you have the indentifiable skills we procure around here. Guess what, if you’re
        going to make a lot of money somewhere else, or just some money here. Go make a lot, and god bless.
        Lets just stick to the previous, we’ll keep the committments short in time length (on the order of a few months), so you can wiggle out and go do what you want.
        This of course is focused on the MVP type of programmers that want to churn through the newest tools. If you want to learn only a few tools, and longer term commitments are more appetising - bricks and mortar type of commitments are
        probably
        superior - but also getting rarer and rarer as they pay a lot … for not much.

        So to summarize:
        Our goal is to partner with the “hungry” programmer who wants to consume the newest tools on a regular basis, get short turnover cycles, rewards for learning a new skill on the fly to mash with other existing skills. We’ll cut and size
        projects to fit skills and developers as possible - as long as they have potential. This is the focus of this company short term - which is to create MVP products.

        Longer term, team chemistry (if not make up - literally family oriented) will be key over aggressive and talented types. People wiling to commit a lot of hours and focus because the rewards will be split across a group of people favorable
        to
        them (employee owned).

      <span class="rant-text">
        The MVP creation phase should run 3-6 months (with 4-6 weeks of actual billable work).
        The production and support phase should run 5-10 years (current platform functionality is stable).
