        We all want to hire contract/gig work locally as much as possible. This is a system to do it.

        This product was created to attract and retain talented workers today and tomorrow for small (family raising) markets graduating nationally from respected colleges.
        This product addresses imbalances (opinion) in the workplace and culture with cash flows.
        <br>
        <br>
        Promotes companies that are setup to succeed - companies built with profits paid out to the wrong parties end up with talent leaving and no longer on a strong iteration - whether they are still profitable or not - this isn’t the experience
        young people seek
        <br>
        <br>
        Office environment corresponding to today’s needs will greatly encourage people to use the office to improve collaboration and team morale - yet not require a heavy load of hours in office to permit the freedom of the full time employees to
        manage their working hours and contributions to the product

        Elite brains carry teams. Wonder why they leave? Look at the team content. If you get a bunch dead weight - brains will just go
        <br>Mix in some women and spirit and families - the developer doesn’t mind some carry here or there is it’s for more then a lazy old white guy at a desk.
        <br>Also let the developer select the teams - althought co-ed manipulation is superior to picking the best of the best
        <br>This product should encourage these teams to seek the highest talent females (delicious) - not just the cute ones - to make the teams most effective
        <br>The Lincoln market can price this product in at this time and be nationally competitive
        <br>to encourage young women to participate in product cycle takes special care and attention - while women in their 30s and beyond swing stroke for stroke with male counter parts, the challenges on a female during the child bearing years
        are
        greater in my opinion. This product addresses a few of the major issues I see with the inbalance - pay, relevance to the product cycle (knowledge / ability to contribute) and flexibility to participate while living the desired and regular
        imbalance in child rearing responsibilities at a young age.
        <br> A first class seat for people that under go the glorius and challenging in allways process of child bearing requires much more then just family leave to preserve them a fair and legitimate place in the process comparable to the skill
        and
        talent that they compared to people in their category

      <div class="rant-header">LONG TERM MARKET VIEW</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        The city built a ballpark. We'll finance the teams, buy the jerseys, supply the rent (pay) - just to see the game, and we want the game here in our park, so we can watch. This is what we can do and offer - is a situation like this. This
        is how we renew our culture.
        <br>Elite experienced workers that are continuing to retrain on emerging technologies are the key “gig” assets to lead MVP teams - but their cost and age doesn’t cater to location in Lincoln and smaller markets with limited product creation.
        <br> No matter where elite assets reside, chances are they cater to an international audience for the most enticing opportunities - this won’t change anytime soon. The use of these elite professionals to initialize products is as available
        to the
        Lincoln market as any other.

      <div class="rant-header">ENTRY LEVEL FULLTIME PROFESSIONALS</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        They have energy and new skills - but no broad experience
        <br>They may also want to start a family and balance those interests
        <br>Entry level person has weak contacts and needs to transition from college to professional
        <br>take longer to payback results - more learning and training is required to become productive
        <br>Entry level professionals with a limited skillset are hugely benefited where a local team with some personal guidance and instruction and return huge gains.should be the ones to learn the newest technologies and not bother with the older
        technologies.
        <br>1 - setup an MVP with b/leading edge techniques, scaled delivery, dev ops done, an iterative process/tracking sytem in progress
        <br>2 - build the company, benefits, office and all of that for them. This is silly stuff that if done right, they’ll love, but where would they have time to do this, think about htis, etc etc
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">LOCAL EXPERIENCED PART TIME (GIG) WORKERS</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Gigs cater to older people with existing skills and little incentive to retrain
        <br>Gig based professionals are limited in how many emerging technologies they can learn and also maintain stable income - if their current skill pays well their incentive to learn something else is low
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">FEATURES</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Mechanisms to balance pay between male and female workers overall and individually (performance will be compared female to female, and male to male for purposes of pay, but the pool will be graded the same per rank per sex).
        <br>Billing system can track flows (gender, partner company, gig work), quick payout
        <br>Logo for display for meeting standards set by this plan (certification)
        <br>Developer accounts effective at hiring contractors for gig work locally
        <br>Require the participating companies to be located in a geographly small market to encourage in person interaction amongst workers
        <br>Salary and employment insurance for employees new to the market (5 years minimum from a layoff)
        <br>Considerable worksite benefits related to family and personal health, fitness and wellness. These are graded into the salary insurance pool as an overall cost.
        <br>During pregnancy and other life occurances additional gig resources are made available to the employee and considerations are taken to keep the employee relevant (and current if possible) in the product development cycle first, feature
        productivity second. The additional gig resources are optionally under the guidance of the employee - but are probably managed by others on the team - managing additional gig resources isn’t easy.
        <br> Shared resources in the market such as daycare, wifi, public spaces, pet friendly areas and other market spaces intended to promote free (funded) usage.
        <br> Verifies employers and contractors live in the local area (or physically visit the market)
        <br>If companies do not have integrated daycare or nearby daycare for all employees (contractor and otherwise), the Delicious companies will interact at a minimum - this extends to handicap accessible and other obvious culture crashers we
        don’t want. In other words an internal, but obvious and not so private black ball list.

        Integration with local law enfrorcement
        <br>It’s easier to accomplish a child friendly place with verified people (whether identity is exact or not, they’re local and known) - and high observability - not only human eyes but cameras - child spaces should be on camera in the market
        this is public and the power of cameras is effective in this case
        <br>Kid friendly and “reuse” areas. Not all video games - but instead of adult collaboration areas - kid collaboration areas that lend to safe and entertaining interactions for kids.
        <br>Alcohol specific zones so kids can stay out (adult only areas / business only areas)
        <br>Smoking area that is well done and easy and quick to access in the market and it’s location communicated - if people want to smoke, give them a good safe convenient and clean spot to do it.


        <br>(blend)

        Verified local cards are issued to company employees, contractors and visitors. These cards are scanned when visiting a location
        to monitor usage.

        At least one person capable of security guard work is on duty at all times, available to escort people in and out of the market at night.

        In local markets where panhandling and other roughneck types are present, these things are considered in order to
        provide family friendly areas and safe passage to transportation when visiting the market.

        Software is provided to highlight location and queue for resources and assets.

      <div class="rant-text">
        <br>Technology center featuring handicap friendly tech - and easy access so people can check it out (like a retail display and check it out ability)

      <div class="rant-header">FUNDED COLLABORATION SPACES (PURCHASE OPTIONAL)</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        <br>Retail Clothes and other displays - but display only - not inventory - like shop windows where you order things - the idea being these are like art displays for branding people to see - and if the locations are sponsered then it makes
        sense
        to have several tables (possibly 1-2 hour usage limit) that could sit and enjoy the retail rotation (possibly national chains support and sponsor this already - i.e. airport windows?). Kid friendly as much as possible.
        <br>The stores can be like Sears catalog stores - except stuff is shipped to your house - and these are ordering assitance / display locations in the market
        <br>There are huge number of products, local market specific retail selection is a valuable service - and so we want to make it possible for “retail people” (those that look through as many products as possible and narrow down the range the
        looks best for the local market). Art is similar to this, but so is clothes, food (not just on sale) and other personal items. This isn’t to have inventory on hand, but retail selection display ability. The money is in market eco-system -
        the idea is to provide the money in a fair way to promotes the service (retail production selection) in competitive way so we get the most value from the money used here.
        <br>Not everyone wants to drink or eat something all the time, but they do want the spaces funded/maintained, etc.

      <div class="rant-header">ABILITY TO ADAPT AND SPECIALIZE IN TECHNOLOGIES</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        <br>In general MS is banned except where they have exceptional products like LUIS or BabylonJS. Otherwise they are the corporate example of building in loads to software. This culture isn’t that.
        <br>Kids only areas / mixing areas / enough designation to allow parents to determine how much their kids mix with adults and also how much adults want to mix with kids.
        <br>Technology demonstration zones - geeks have toys and love to share and show and hand down
        <br>A key goal of the market setup is to make sure no one gets permanent loads that permanently inhibit the system. “Corporate” poeple will try at every turn to get loads and fees from this - at an ongoing basis - a long lasting fountain of
        money for them and their no longer working desecendents. This will cap this system at a generation or two before it’s got all these old fingers in it bleeding it and slowing it down. This market is the very essence of stopping this corporate
        suck it from the youth theme that is holding small markets back. Suck from the world, spit it in your local market …. Don’t suck it from home and spit it to the world.
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">FAMILY FOCUS</div>
      <div class="rant-text">

        <br>Having spouses and family on the payroll is fine - if a spouse isn’t working another job - then that couple is working at the company anyways and this is a quality way for existing companies to reform to meet the standard. This isn’t
        meant
        to encourage families to share positions - companies have to consider if they want to pay 2 salaries for 1 position - so arbitration will need to be used at times for flakely situations.
        <br>This is not designed to be a marraige buster - quite the opposite - encourage professional collaboration in all situations for good of the product. Personal encounters are optional, probably limited in most cases, but in almost all
        situations I’ve been in (as far as marital status, etc etc) - people like to meet in person a little bit. People like to meet those they work with - but this isn’t meant as a tool to force hookups in relationships that don’t need that.
        <br>daycare features required for existing companies entering market
        <br>Integrated family care - situations where someone is need to be present at work but has a sick child, situations need to allow spaces for family members that for either phycial or physcological reasons need isolation - these areas are
        provided and done well.
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">CONSIDERATIONS IN A LOCAL GIG ECONOMY</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        If you want a quality gig pool locally - you might want to take real good care of them. Brains like to climb at times and rest at others - lending to the nature of the gig environment. This product tries to help both edges - climb on skills
        and options and get a loan or scholarship to tide over a lazy or free floating brain.
        These are the kind of “soft” tools you need to function in a local gig market - where if you stop feeding work to someone - you can package a scholarship to train a new skill, etc. Developers have money and hearts - but it’s hard to be soft
        with gig based employees. Talented gig employees will at times need a lift to stay around the area, this tool hopes to bridge the gap without being too cute. It’s very much in deveopers interest to keep a talented pool of gig workers,
        companies do not compete on a product basis with other local companies anymore. For the most part, competing on employees is directly is pretty much over to.
        The worldwide gig market is a difficult soup - this is meant as a product to guild up locals to the outside reality of the market.
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">SUPPORT AND ENCHANCE THE LOCAL CASH FLOWS</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Payment system optimized for local payments worker to worker (subbed projects) and certified employer to worker. The payment system tracks the gender rate of gig payments. The payment delivers cash (charged debit cards) to any local worker
        that stops in and certifies - and uses other forms of payment with minimal load (preferrably no load locally). Payment system when possibly pays instantly (same day) - and requires no direct interation between employer and worker (“cash”
        counter in one or more locations in market). Trusted gig workers can break up projects and tasks amongst themselves without the money taking a load as it’s transfered between workers. The payment system is focused on facilitating these
        collaborations and funded by the insurance product, not loads and fees. Where loads and fees make sense, they will be applied to transactions - probably due to cost per transaction external to the billing system.
        The billing, accounting, payroll, inventory and legal services provided free and subsidized are designed to remove the burden of delivering these services for small sized technology companies, but also assist in gather the needed gender
        based salary and gig distribution feedback to load the system. While combining this among a set of local technology companies using experienced local gig employees makes sense on it’s own, combining it with the mechanism to enforce gender
        based distribution of compensation for most participants to utilize all possible integrated business software. The usage of these features will be most required except in cases where the participant has sifficient ability to provide audit on
        compensation distributions.
        Risk and administration is very limited due to the direction of the top feeding of the employees - they select and flow the funds to gigs, so the risk is based on decisions of employees, fraud in the market is difficult to produce.
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">MARKET GUIDELINES / POLICIES / NORMS / EDUCATION</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        When a meeting includes an employee or contractor that requires daycare seat(s) - the expense is included in the meeting to secure space and make sure a baby sitting resource is included. This is always blended in the cost as required and
        not discussed as a load.
        <br>A contractor is able to warn an employer of criminal and or financial history in order to prevent a collaboration at the business or social level the employer doesn’t prefer. This is intended to promote a business transaction but prevent
        a
        social one where a local person is happy to provide work to a challenged employee - but doesn’t seek the local personal/ongoing connection.
        <br>While product focused brains are critical to innovate with industry level features if they are unavailable the market helps transfer gig based resources able to iterate the process to continue low level advancements (bug fixes, simple
        high
        productivity changes) (market protection for fellow companies - since similar skillsets no reason to let a revenue stream fall).
        <br>Market level guidelines for gig workers - specifically confidentiality, creditionals, work product, notes on hours and fixed price work for invoicing - a how to. Specific companies and developers can attach additional notes about policy
        for
        their particular process.
        <br>There are obstacles lthat remote work promotes that local work used to overcome - this is delays in humans doing things like creating authorizations in systems or taking time to screenshare and walk someone thru a process - in a real
        office
        someone would see someone stuck and help. This system wants to capture that local synergy in a digital way - in the spirit of local collaboraters that isn’t as important with remote workers - not the task itself - but the unblock other
        “friendly” workers to make sure their path is ok.
        <br>Required short onboarding for both contractors and employers and agencies (split income alliances of contractors) - optional longer - this provides direction to “default” policies for the market - and the ability to “customize” the
        policy
        terms per company/contractor - and these “exceptions” to default policy show as flags when inspecting profiles, etc, and starting a new gig for the first time for both sides (before final agreement)
        <br>Library of market techniques - these would be firebase, extended reality and other local specialties that are common amongst companies or a standard a local company wants to share to the market (and specify - optionally - a “best”
        practice
        method) - and these would include dates so people get respect of when they created a document - techniques age and tools change.
        <br>After a certain level of income or number of jobs, a gig worker gets access to upper level white papers and training - and possible scholarships (for rewards for jobs complete)
        <br>As brainsplicer is written develop tutorial, jira and other process documentation to base other companies on (software development step by step using the doc trail of brainsplicer MVP creation)
        <br>Companies that have a hard time reforming payroll to meet standards could provide scholarships to female gig workers as an offset to promote better practice moving forward
        <br>A scholarship can be used to attend one or more meetups (etc) related to a subject - good way to get these more co-ed oriented
        <br>Explainer for contractors that the money they earn is 1099 and needs to have taxes removed and a brief estimate of a what a self employed person with no real business expenses should expect to deduct and pay in quarterly, and have the
        contractor “agree” to terms that they understand and have read. Make this a heavy click thru on the first onboarding - so it’s clear that we pay the money and it’s on them to do it right, we’ll help with tax tools and techniques - but once
        the 1099 money is paid it’s not our issue and there is no confusion.
        <br>Additionally explain we don’t send 1099’s or our clients, it’s on the contractor to record (and we provide yearly history of earnings) earnings from each company and do their own taxes. This has nothing to do with us - we just transfer
        payments. Our clients companies are no longer required to send 1099 unless you do 200+ transactions.
        <br>For shops that carry stock and / or can order stock, a collaborative store to help people in the market identify they can order products from the vendors in the market (and possibly have them delivered there as well) (API for voice
        search
        across the market) (Possibly limits on this so one vendor doesn’t dominate, or offer preferred listing at a cost, etc)
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">SPONSORED LOCATIONS</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        - where coffee is free and wifi is free - intended for people moving around locations that need to stop in for 15 minutes but don’t want to spend 10$ each time. So a Delicious location is sponsored and promotes employees
        and contractors to stop and use wifi without buying anything. This keeps things fast - don’t have to wait and buy and all that just to sit down for a few. Also people do want to contribute to the spaces they use, etc, so this is a win-win.
        <br>The theme here is a Delicious “person” needs to be able to show they are - not to be elite - but to show they’ve “paid” for their place in the location by being a member (no one wants to free load). Possibly a daily multi-location pass -
        and
        each location gets credit that you visited - so a base payout to a location to play, and then bonus pay for visits.
        <br>Market level benefits (like free coffee, wifi, shared daycare) - could be extended to non participants (either indvidual or companies). This makes a lot of sense with shared/sponsored locations, less so with daycare - it would a market
        by
        market blend.
        <br>Non food stores can participate by providing an area to work - tables, etc - similar to the coffee shop inside barnes and noble. Normally a contractor would feel strange stopping in a small shop - but this is a win-win - a small shop
        wants
        traffic - and a contractor will like a non coffee shop setting as something very different. These should be kid friendly - and need a good reason if not. They would get a small reward by participating, but could also offer some other service
        like hair care, etc etc.
        <br>Optionally locations can be pet friendly. This is obviously difficult, but desired by many.
        <br>A general theme of the market is to make spaces flexible and usable by many - so we get a compression of people and activity in a smaller area - more eyes watching the store fronts. And we want “qualified” people (not vagrants) moving
        between locations with ease and comfort
        <br>Market wide wifi for qualified people - also have it easy to use everywhere - not a different login places so people can move easily and quickly
        <br>Handicap assisted zone - while all market places should be handicap accessable - designate a part where it’s most easy to enter the market and make sure the nearby locations are the most equipped to support handicapped people
        (wheelchair,
        seeing eye dog and otherwise). This during the day might include a guide or helper to assist and make sure the resources are delivered best. The idea being the restroom and other personal facalities are catered to disabled in this area - not
        just accessible. The market could designate this area and provide additional money to support this. The facilities should cater to include handicap people as much as possible in the technology experience - including large screens and other
        handicap related technogly interfaces. Also private and regulated spaces - some of these people don’t get out often and these visits might be about access to technology and / or small groups - not a public/social purpose.
        <br>On duty guard available to escort females through parts of the market to enter and exit the market at all hours - this is especially important at night to have escort in lonely/vacant and dark parts of the market.
        <br>This plan isn’t intended to chase out vagrants and weirdos - at the same time it’s meant to encourage free flow and participation in the shops and locations in the market for qualified people. It’s intended to use resources to enable the
        pace of remote work to match local collaboration - online - you open skype and start the meeting, in a market you head to a location and buy something, configure the wifi, find a table, look for the others, make sure you have some privacy if
        you need it, etc. There is more to do, we want to make that easier because people want to do this - but it’s expensive versus other non personal options.
        <br>This is for markets that have large available spaces - Delicious will support shared usage of this space which encourages people to stop in shops and provides lots of spots for gig and other workers to hangout.
        <br>Participating locations and shops in the market can offer virtual appliances and other extended reality retail location specific information
        <br>The idea here is that traffic (people stopping in) alone will drive revenue - not just sales - promotes having a neat display of stuff - even if it doesn’t sell there - people visit and all sides win.
        <br>Market Wide (optional) POS system with minimal load - so people can search across the market and order on their phone, walk to the location to pick up the item with no cash, etc.

      <div class="rant-text">
        Since the product team is formed at a specific time, a business vehicle (corporation preferred) is also formed at the same time - with the ability to encode Delicious Standards into the charter. -- "adheres to Delicious Standards(tm)" in the
        charter. Require that level of commitment, where we (the group insurer) enter in arbitration with an upper hand and the court system is out. These standards will have monetary caps in terms of payouts and penalties - so exclusive arbitration
        is reasonable in this case.
        <br>Option if reasonable to roll corporation into mutual if independant (can buy itself out from original investment)
        the salary guarantee and other worksite “pool” funds left over from the insured period roll into a mix of stock/mutual/private employee directed vehicles (including direct payout to the employees as cash).
        <br>The charter and initial requirements would last only for the first 5 years, but the tag can be retained permeantly after
        vesting formula of funds and stock: focus on the early employees having more weight - balanced with significance to stay relevant (typical formula for balancing bonus, etc).
        <br>Take greed out of the venture for the funding and put the power and risk to the teams to scale the company revenue / user base
        <br>If the company pays off the guarantee - they’re totally independant (option for ideal situation - where they are a subsidairy and/or the original investor requires some type of hold this is waived)
        <br>Final Arbitrator is a person local to the specific market with vested interest in town, but required to act only in exceptional situations in this role
        <br>Left over gig money is directed towards charity or paid out to a local gig collaborator (i.e. FUSE) as a suppliment to continue gig related support
        <br>These young kids are going to do a lot of stupid things. They’ll sue the parent companies, they’ll make mistakes, they’ll make bad choices. Lets keep their focus on the product iterations, not all of this other noise (corporate ground
        game).
        <br>This “corporate ground game” is the same old stuff, lets manipulate the environment to leave this stuff off the product development teams. Let the good old people do this work.

        people wont work 40 hrs per week every week anymore, so having a child while flexing in product (hard) dev work is possible - and much of this work is probably done at home or a preferred location. While a good amount of office time is
        expected, think of the office as more of college professor usage not old school clock it for 40.
        <br>The office is meant to be of high value to local gig based employees collaborating with the team. The amount of shared benefits (i.e. daycare, etc) is outside the scope of this product for gig workers. Only gender/partner

        <br>Brainsplicer plugin for unity, atom, android studio, etc (except VS and 360 support is banned) - so gig work is easy to bust up and hand out right from work tools- plugin for JIRA

        <br>easy to invoice hours, track hours on fixed projects (for reference) and show online/available status.
        <br> Time tracking possibly - maybe just guidelines/suggestions on how to invoice and track time - for both contract and fulltime employees -
        <br>with the flexible and many times remote environment invoicing is a very important form of communication
        <br> for sizing the next feature and iteration for cost and time
        <br>***REST API so client companies and contractors can integrate gigs and payments, etc into their own systems
        <br>Use common billing system in a market for ease of local gig resource consumption
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">GIG WORK QUEUE AND HISTORY</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Work Queue of tasks submitted by employers with a list of contractors or more loose rules. Contractors can have one of these at a time to keep them from hogging these - also to keep the queue flattened out (as many as possible working on
        tasks). This allows employers to easily farm out a large range of small tasks (1-4 hours) - and contractors to self serve the tasks.
        <br>The idea of braingrafter is the employees and clients can both see the gig resources and results (especially 3d works in /edit)
        <br>Work can be rated as desired level vs finished product - but worker’s performance grade is separate - this makes it easy to say “I want this done a lot better” - but rate the workers performance based on how they did, as many times more
        iterations are needed and wanted - but things need to be rated as they are (things being 3d assets)
        <br>“Production Credits” - contractors can specify whether they want credit (to be listed / or not) - and employers can specify to include/exclude, etc - possibly with levels “500” is in, etc.
        <br>One key goal is to inform both contractor and employer of locality - while the system doesn’t force either to chose local, it assumes the preference exists. Same with gender with respect to female preferred to balance cash flows.
        <br>One key goal (again) is keep the loads out of the gig cash flows. This is critical.
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">COLLABORATION FEATURES</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        <br>Allows for loose local collectives where one person is the communicator with client and others bill work hours on a gig - but they don’t have to form a partnership, etc local to bill, the system cleans this up for them until they want to
        do
        it themselves
        <br>Creditionals storage for companies - and a trust level verified for local contractors so that logging in and pulling source for local companies happens quickly and without trouble (or documents, etc etc - that are confidential and behind
        security access). Options to store creditionals and or OAuth login support to systems, etc.
        <br>Tightly integrate existing project management systems (JIRA/trello/github, etc) - with JIRA first to make it easy to link and navigate between systems and reference related technique documentation
        <br>Option by employer or contractor to filter themselves from the others results for gigs or contractor searches
        <br>Employer contacting contractor can remain anonymous until otherwise
        <br>Allow gig workers and employers to specify how much personal/social interaction they prefer during and after small jobs. Many contractors don’t want to do local work and be someones little helper - so they would prefer to remain anon.
        Same
        with employers, they may spend a few hundred to do things on someone they don’t want an ongoing personal connection to. If people specify this upfront and clearly, it should provide a lot of utility to the relationship and matching. This
        isn’t intended for devious tasks - all transactions will be highly visible - with direct business value not that important - the gig money is equivalent to salary from the business salary pool.
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">CONTRACTOR FEATURES</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        <br>tool to find/select/perform gig related work.
        <br>When a budget is given for a project, the gig worker can use part of it and turn in the result for feedback or complete on a partial budget (a custom car avatar, etc, might need a few iterations in one budget, and the employer will like
        to know how much is left by how much bucks in the bucket for it).
        <br>Users are both employers and contractors - while only partner companies introduce money into the system (originate payments) - projects can be spliced. There is no intention to hide work history or cost at any point in the system, the
        ability to trace who did what when and for how much out weighs jealous concerns - with the concept the work is done and paid for quickly - and if it does well people want to trace. At the same time, costs will be heavy and unwanted
        work/workers weeded out (assigned to other tasks). It’s in all parties interest to deliver the most value to the stakeholders.
        <br>Academics doesn’t provide the experience and skills people need, the gig economy does, and it’s a lot more rewarding to “teach” local resources.
        <br>Scholarships can be specific in nature (like study a certain technique - use blender -$50 to watch stuff for a few hours) - then this is noted on the contractors profile that they’ve been given this scholarship and should know this
        technique. The idea is if I give out a task and someone doesn’t have a couple minor skills - I can assign scholarships after looking thru their profile - pay those and assign the task with the budget I have for it. This way the education is
        separated - provided - but not repeated. The idea is to pay for the skill up for new people - but the right skills at the right time - but not get taken advantage of more then needed.
        <br>While most small gigs will be fixed price, we still need a way to measure hours to split and rank the pay for gender
        <br>The focus of the education in the market is not to cover all topics, but to have quality and updated techniques the market uses. The point is to provide a tight collection of quality material for a market - that is iterating as the
        market skillsets are also moving.
        <br>Employees and gig workers need to be paid for time spent - compensation for time spent vs happiness with quality of work are different things, and this product/arbitration heavily favors the worker being paid for time spend (upwork does
        this very well as well).
        <br>One goal behind the education is to allow an older worker that wants to learn new skills to climb up in technique without a major instant career/job change. A sabatical ability so to speak built in. The ability to come back to a
        respectible
        position after taking a multi year break is challenging for both company and employee to create that position - this hopefully bridges the gap by accelerating the employee’s skills and the companies knowledge of those skills.
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">CONTROL OF MONEY ORIGIN</div>
      <div class="rant-text">

        <br>While the project tool is setup to flow gig money side to side and downward - only the Delicious Companies inject money into the system. While a contractor can run their own private project, and sub out tasks, they can’t load money into
        the system, instead they either need the project “sponsered” by a Delicious Company (who puts the money in), or they use the earnings in the system from doing gigs to hire other contractors to perform gigs for their project. It’s a regular
        thing
        to do some of your own projects in addition to projects for hire - the idea is they can the use the system as much as it used them but not more. This keeps the system a payment system - if we allow other sources of money into the system from
        less controlled vendors, we become a marketplace that will attract supervision. A market has great risks, a payment system is a companies choice of how to pay money out.
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">PAYOUT OPTIONS</div>
      <div class="rant-text">

        <br>Include option to pay local landlords from system (so gig workers can pay rent from system from gig funds - no load) - i.e. Century
        <br>rent option could be a check dropped and sent (partial or full) to a qualified landlord with the address on it
        <br>same as previous for child support and other local targets (like fines, fees, dues to select organizations)
        <br>would be "preferred" if an undocumented worker was able to verify local and pay rent without identification (and/or bank acct)
        <br>verified local payments for gigs are ungated (instant) - and pay outs to local landlords instant (ungated)
        <br>Accounts are quick payout via upwork, paypal and other services so contractors can be paid instantly when needed
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">CONTRACTOR WORK HISTORY</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Extensive consideration is given to entry level contractors and the failings they will encounter.
        <br>Instead of a permanent black marked record of failues, the system will implement forgiveness and
        all sides wil recognize the challenges of young people entering this market as entry level development
        contractor. People make a range of mistakes, this is about climbing and getting better, not profile history.
        <br>Successful employer/contractor relationships come from iterations - sometimes those fail - we want to do all
        we can do soften the resistance to repeat work on both sides.
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">CONTRACTOR TRAINING</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Paying people to train and learn is a fact of life in the gig economy - this product tries to blend the willingness to do this with the desire to keep bucks
        and brains local. A 22 year old kid isn't going to know all the tech today to create an MVP "quick" ... but
        they can take the wheel just fine and make changes to a tight and new stack. In fact this is just what I would
        want to do...Brains do dumb stuff like screw around until bills pile up and they need quick payment. The national
        gig market caters to fast and up front payments to brains, and this system wants to make sure it caters the same
        to the local brains. Young professionals need to gain skills to actually contribute “work products” to teams.
        While this isn’t actually required for a company to succeed - but employees get satisfaction from actually
        contributing to the product in some way -even if minor. The skill doesn’t have to be elite - the point is to
        participate in the iterations to learn and grow the brain coverage on the product to introduce ongoing innovations.
        The “skill requirement” is to get “hands on” experience - but the actual contribution of the skill’s direct output to the work required per iteration is of minor importance at best. Some people have to get work done, but coding (or related
        ongoing changes to the product) isn’t the hard part -
        getting the right changes in the right places without resulting errors (brain coverage) is way more critical as the product gains a maturing audience.

      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">VIRTUAL REALITY, AUDIO AND VIDEO RELATED SOFTWARE FEATURES</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Integrated video and audio features for gigs - where a file can be included, screen shots, times, comments, designed to make it easy to pass these items with comments back and forth for edits
        <br>3D / extended reality calendar to view gig gant chart etc
        <br>Digital (esp 3d / model / texture / scene) transfer easily to view and relate to contracts. While JIRA, etc has a range of features (easy to include a link) - the idea here is to have a model/avatar viewer to make it easy to see 3D
        assets
        that were create by a gig worker on contracts. (work history type of thing for 3d stuffs - integrated into system).
        <br>Model/avatar markup system so it’s easy to include the model, make notes and pass changes back and forth in the system, including bids, etc.
        <br>While some embedded documentation makes sense, this isn’t the focus of the app - there is a ton of that stuff that exists. The 3D specialization is different, that’s a distinction based feature(s).
        <br>By having 3D specialized features - we allow anonymous contracts to be possible for a large number of content editing tasks - while not required - the employees may not want to know who is doing the content work …. really.
        <br>Shared Conference tool to visit scenes and view models and textures that both developer and client share state real time

      <div class="rant-header">MARKET READY TECHNICAL SUPPORT</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Because teams located in a specific Delicious Market(™) can be guaranteed hours immediately upon hiring for training and collaborating with new team members to ramp them up on the process as well as specific techniques while adding new
        features for the first few product iterations. The process, timing and expectations of features and complexity will be transferred as team starts out with a certain “flow” (rate of work expectation). Even if they fall below this standard
        short term, they will have collaborated previously in such a flow.
      </div>

      <div class="rant-header">GIG MARKET DETAILS</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        In order to create a local “free trade / cash pay out / pay in” zone, the local market could create a sub market for a few “companies” to exist to wash these payments external to the system at the minimum rate the market would allow. These
        companies will come under tax and criminal scrutiny, both national, local and international and at times will need to go out of business. The scheme is to have a flow of these that can continue this local pipe - this will be on the specific
        market to create these.
        <br>Internal employee transfer/trade/employee choice migrate to another delicious company is preferred (the salary pool and other benefits could be graded/retained with respect to favor this)
        <br>Technologies to be studyied could also be funded by outside sources, i.e. Firebase, WebGL (GC companies), LUIS (MS), etc - to keep gig workers refreshing skills companies will need.
        <br>The only people placing/paying gig opportunities are vetted local employers - removing offers involving anything unrelated to work - while daycare and personal assist services could be possible, these would still be thru a company to
        assist
        a professional person - nothing in a personal nature would flow thru this system, this is intended directly for gig work to support business operations.
        <br>Where possible the system should provide anonymity between the client and contractor - the client isn’t obligated to hire again or has any control over the contractor, etc. Keep it local, remove the personal by default (when preferred).
        <br>Internal system profiles about gig workers - amount earned / job success, etc like upwork - so loans and grants can use this info in consideration (work history) - this info anon as possible
        <br>Church and charity as targets of gig payments an option (market specific/ company specific)
        <br>Verified Local, Verified Female - actual physical location in market where somone can get certified (without id) and receive cash or a debit card able to be charged (similar) plasma for direct pay. Contractors are required to
        periodically
        stop in to verify they are local.
        <br>Tracking system used to load gig resources used via gender/location, etc to encourage preferred usage
        <br>Non Delicious Companies can participate as companies/agencies in the market place under identical conditions or favorable. Tracking of categories of payments is preferred to receive the same benefits - but would not be worth the loss of
        excluding any entity in the local or external market wanting to do business in the local gig economy.
        <br>Any non male gender is considered female for payout purposes, male for payment tagging (credit)
        <br>In general salary insurance in addition means “most” benefits retention as possible included
        <br>Employers can privately mark favored contractors (then who can be earmarked / uppicked for grants/loans, etc)
        <br>Female (pregnancy age) skill specialization and gig/contractors given scholarships to train to have overlap for the specific skillsets (not product knowledge)
        <br>The gig market will only emphasize employment history where it makes sense - this isn’t upwork - this is about handing out gigs locally over job history - we want to give the locals the 2nd and 3rd chance to succeed, not let a small gig
        failure (2-500$) dent their chance to do more gigs and climb into a skillset that can land them a full job.
        <br>Local “can be available queue” - most gig workers can work on one or more projects at a time, with the ability to switch on their preference. I think most gig workers and people hiring gigs would prefer local - and if given the chance
        delay
        remote work to perform local work now. I would have a queue where a gig work can say “full avail” - “busy but avail local” - so a local gig hiring can select a contractor that is ok that is totall open, or select a contractor that is busy
        local but would shift things in leiu of going to the remote non-local market.
        <br>The challenges to administering a plan like this are significant - but also remember the burdens of working with the people in the local market are best suited to a local player.

        The gig economy is a reality. The gig economy and it’s ability to mix teams and assets and resources and deliver unique products prove it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.
        <br>Local companies can utilize the gig market to develop local resources (sharing technique and developing talent directly)
        developer/product people would be given weekly budgets of ~20% of their salary or more to spend on gig work related to personal tasks - in addtion to directing gig resources in a regular flow
        <br>For local work that can be performed anonymously and paid as such between parties, the billing software should allow this if the market chooses - removing personal barriers to bit work and simple tasks that don’t require a peronsal
        connection - but the money remains local
        <br>A “gig/contractor” free-trade zone - where local money between parties is largely a form of cash (direct unloaded/controlled payment) - and is tax free and load free …. Create this “pipeline” market by market; putting loads into this
        pipe is
        complete stupid - no market will want to do it.

        <br>Personal information is exposed only as needed per contractor - things such as work history, loan repayment, job success %, amount earned are shown as needed to encourage lending and job reception - but not as a personal info respository
        <br>This system/product is a work market - not a chat history or personal performance history on a quarterly or yearly basis there should be a rolling loss of history - so in total nothing older then 6 months is in the system. This is not a
        local knowledge repository - and it must not be - upwork is controlling too much information related to all projects in the world. While we may supply some dispute resolution - it’s not aimed at - and it’s not a market professional/personal
        research tool. Regularly dumping information and retaining history for a “fixed’ windows helps ensure all parties of such.
        <br>Gig workers that have done successful work previously are general very honest people - making quality candidates for scholarships and loans (without verification). A 4 or 8 hr scholarship/grant/loan to study a skill could just be “taken”
        -
        but it’s likely if they’re not doing anything else, they’ll study that stuff.
        <br>A gig worker could take a 3 month sabotical from one Delicious company to do a gig at another Delicious company - say implement a new api or technique
        <br>In the system a gig worker can flag if seeking permanent position, scholarships requested during downtime - also an employer can tag a gig worker for a scholarship that becomes available when they are idle - not intended as upwork -
        instead

        Companies in local market can sponsor the bank to make loans specific to certain technologies, but remain anonymous as the source of the support - and the bank will select which contractors get supported education loans or grants to
        educate
        (this removes the expectation the sponsored training leads to paid work, but allows the employer to contribute to the local skills market with influence).
        <br>Bankers from local or national lending institutions are vetted and only certain lenders are given status to view additional personal informaiton on loan candidates - approved by local market arbitrator
        <br>The ability to anonymously seed/grant/loan money for specific skills allows them to fund specific training for local assets in case they need them so they can hire local, if they’re not needed, hopefully it’s a useful skill and the
        contractor is useful in the market elsewhere or nationally more viable personally
        <br>Include local banks in software to provide short term loans to software users, especially gig workers - the loans can be backed by employers (training) or local bankers can accept the bank risk based on work history (these are consider
        training loans - develop a skill during down time, or take a risk and study a new skill to level income).
        <br>Loans are submitted into a queue and all banks are able to look at the loan and either request more information, offer to accept or pass - rather then the loan submitted to a specific bank to be directly rejected - this allows gig
        workers
        to
        request small amounts of money for various items without getting directly rejected by lenders (remove the personal interaction in the local lending process - but the local lender makes the choices via the system)
        <br>Loan and grant performance history - were jobs taken for the skill after grants and loans, jobs at all?
        <br>A local lender can participate to build up history with gig workers who may have a difficult time otherwise building up credit and reputation to receive a home loan. Local banks make loans to difficult cases when they know enough
        conditions,
        this is a place to help.

        <br>technologies like Firebase, 3D modeling and Javascript should be focused, as these are in international demand now and for sometime to come
        <br>One key to the gig based economy is instant payment. Gig based employees screw around do whatever they want until they really need some money (like rent, or beer or drugs, literally … something small will motivate them to work for a day
        or
        a
        few to pay rent). The ability to deliver instant payments to gig employees is huge - they have past due rent, all kinds of needs that quick pay works. The developers on the team need a way to pay instantly as a more competitive advantage
        in
        selecting gig based employees over quantity! With intimate knowledge of the gig economy this product can incorporate a billing system that in addition to providing monitoring the flows by category, it can also respond to the unique

        Workflows today involving difficult topics use a variety of digitial tools to communicate - and are superior to classic verbal meetings. While some in person scheming is certainly the intent of the office workplace, encounters requiring
        challenging meetings are a thing of ths past - challenging (complex) topics are best assisted with digital tools so people can review. The opportunity to socialize and intermix is a key feature of the office place for mostly remote IT
        workers - including others friends and family (as they visit in tow).
        <br>
        Additionally for new technology boundary pushing companies - this product looks to deliver expert level tools for payments (especially gigs) and billing that encourage best practices for business today. Brains need to focus on their specific
        technology, not spend time on general business practices - that while being good at these does matter a lot, it’s not the right place to spend product brains.
        Activity in the local gig market must take into consideration the conditions in the remote market for both sides. Many times it makes sense for either side to utilize remote - but from my experience both sides prefer to use local - it’s just
        very hard to do. Rather then “change” habits - this product considers the conditions of the local gig market over the remote market. The remote gig market is very well served, and competing wtih upwork isn’t in the scope of this payment
        product.
        Possible matching role - while headhunters rarely actually know what people can do, asking one local gig worker which other gig worker can do tasks is probably a lot more valuable and should be blended in. While friends recommend friends,
        this generally isn’t a bad thing, programmers also will usually give you a fair take on what/who you need.
        The gig economy holds a lot of potential for instantly available technology skills to create functionality, on the downside there is a lot less ownership on projects, making project owners more important and stretched then ever. Time to
        deliver for MVP or iterative product features is as critical as keeping costs down - the gig economy can help with these needs. Can is the key word - with these positive results eluding most teams. Understanding that talented gig workers
        want new challenges and to climb and to find these climbers and work with them produces the best results. The people looking to farm an existing skill until it wears out without reskilling aren’t likely to be the closedown/integration type
        of programmers you need to finish projects and features.

        <br>(Possible) Options where if one Delicious company goes big it pays in “some” additional to the pool if the pool has been damaged by other Delicious failures/salary/gig payout. This isn’t meant to payoff the Delicious company, but rather
        repair the local market specific pools if they’re been hurt (a thanks we made it gesture written in - but graded to be fair) The amount would be bsaed on the intial premium. This way one or more companies and the market can celebrate
        “rewarding” sucess with payback - and have it fair and understood what level works. The idea being a moderate sucess can be just as glorius for both as a huge success with respect to market “status”.

        top slots (say male rank 1 vs female rank 1 50% split for the 2 salaries added up) - so that the pay is decent graded between gender, but when one or more male or female top ranked employees cause a strange offset a blending mechanisms to
        spread the evening over a few ranks - but still even the gender pay.
        <br>A transfer between delicious companies (if friendly) could also include tenure - this is related where a company would spin off and back in - and the employees retain “tenure” related to retirement - in this case additional vestment of
        the
        company or payout funds in case of success could be transferred - the idea to capture overlapping skills if the product market is strong in one vs another - while providing enough reward for an important player to jump
        <br>Team members are able to transfer gig account balances between them for favors - such as personal training - to offset the time lost by the training employee. Also if an employee is absent, and another employee is covering their feature
        work, the resources can be transferred to be used to support the work by the active employee.
        <br>Today with budgets, investments, gig payouts, etc - employees know as much about the workings of the company as they do about the source code. Pay levels will be exposed to more people then regular to verify the pay (both gig and salary)
        is
        metered (rank and total) out as evenly as possibly between the sexes. Once the positions are hired, best as possible, the female employees will be ranked and pay will be graded amongst them such that the pot nearly evens the mens pots. In
        the case of an odd batch (3 v 2) - the top 2 in each will be matched, ranked and graded for pay. While adding or removing employees there will be a grace period, but once gender ratios are evened out with selective hiring, the previous
        imbalance in pay can be evened out with grading moving forward on a 3 month type of range for the scale. In the case of a female over balanced company, instead of paying the left over male employees more, the money can be slide into gig
        based programming, the intent of this system is not to scale up lessor skilled male based developer resources - and it’s unlikely this will be the case with grace periods to fill open positions. Arbitrator can make exception for a contractor
        or employee that is of special importance and rate or remove their salary from pool consideration.
        <br>If a company becomes female heavy, gig based compensation benefits will grade down, but not salary penalties to offset the male income. The idea is to not penalize the pool for female related expenses more exceptionally heavy then
        needed.
        <br>Female ratios: min count: 40%, min total salaries: 40, rank per class salary: 90% class to class
        <br>Capped payouts on gig resource budgets and salary payouts (some per company and scaled per market reduce risk)
        <br>Any money leftover in the salary pool after the 5 year period is converted in pay for the employees (either retirement or direct checks)
        <br>Since the product is driven by the motive of the client companies, not the billing system, it should keep the loads out of the system - making money flow between parties many times without reducing
        <br>Underwritten on a per company basis - product defintion adjusted per market

      <div class="rant-header">DESRIED PRODUCT VEHICLE</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        The company most likely will be formed from entry level engineers and the remaining product knowledge people from the MVP creation. The MVP engineers are likely gone at this juncture (or leaving). The MVP should be of elite design and
        implementation, including an iterative process in place to add features effectively. The team will iterate new features to maintain a market pace, starting with industry leading techniques, platforms and API's. This provides a small company
        team 5-10 people - mixing local salary/fulltime resources with local and remote gig resources, and local and remote clients to compete on a large stage with a focused presence. The skills and techniques initially trained/learned should last
        this period and not require a heavy reskilling. Development process removes trivial tasks off of the product team and either uses techniques and external products to meet those needs, or consumes gig resources. Trivial tasks can be
        considered as challenging but don’t require product specific knowledge and once complete the code or work done is a generic work product that can be utilized by the team at large and/or another gig resource.
        <br>(blend this)
        <br>This is a regular flow if you want a leading/bleeding edge product for your company - have an mvp person like me write it. It simple takes too long for your people with high product knowledge to learn the latest technology and figure out
        the
        most suitable tools to their task on an occasional basis. MVP teams spend massive time in learning technology - they prefer to spend time on implementing technology features - not product features that involve redundent coding (similar code
        is in the product already)..
        <br>(end blend)
        <br>Consider a product teams as 3-5 employees scaling to 10-15 over 5 years.
        <br>Focus on Firebase, Javascript and Virtual Reality technologies are preferred.
        <br>focus on product features and iterate in a target market.
        <br>The vehicle owner can be one or more corporations that use the product.
        <br>Form a team fresh out of college with seeking years of experience in a competitive but safe position
        <br>Able to use experienced resources to accomplish a range tasks to save bandwidth/focus/energy for product related development
        <br>Neptism is fine - teams with friends is fine, these are meant to be tight groups, and if people leave they do, we have pooled gig resources to help manage turnover
        <br>Products that the developers can manage at their experience level - and produce industry noticable results - the idea being that talent plays to an audience, and they need a chance to make plays (features that count)
        <br>Existing large companies may create a new product team in a vehicle for 5 years to focus on a new version of a product with a new code base and new techniques to replace an existing product or a migration with breaking business changes.
        The
        concept then converts to finding measurable goals and incentives for the team to iterate/evolve the product into a profitable industry tool for the company.
        <br>The team/vehicle that administers this plan in a specific market can be setup as one of the teams - removing the arbitration roles into a local respected player (bank or insurer preferred) - the team would then be able to generate
        synergy
        with other teams - possibly hosting some of the core workplace assets - such as during the week / during the day available “spot” daycare, cash desk, gig worker hangout while doing scholarships and searching for work while using loans (not
        required, but doesn’t hurt to come and see others).
        <br>Feature based development - where features can be implemented without the intervention of a lead developer to merge and deploy changes - this caters strongly to gig based workers (this isn’t suggesting remove a top brain - but set up
        architecture to allow features - not just UI components - to be encapsulated and handled by a single developer (or group) start to finish that doesn’t require a single point (person) to close.

        Incoming team, deck pitching insurance salesman and investor make the decision to apply Delicious product. It would be applied as a heavy load on entire investment (with investment applied to salaries and rent, etc - adjusted for other non
        labor costs) - 50% - 100% is desired range. For example a $2million dollar investment for a 3 year product team - add Delicious and make it $3 mill.

        <br>Industry specific "demands" can be made - such as sabotical time to volunteer to related causes that need scientific expertise
        <br>Worksite salesman can deliver a range of options to compliment the Delicious package, but it’s only Delicious with certain minimum requirements - the saleman could pitch other than packages with Delicious - it’s in all parties interest

        <br>Pricing for a 5 year team in a small year market is 2 million, or say 4 million (max worst case if no revenue these numbers represent - total lost) - this insurance can be priced in on a market comparison of price basis.
        <br>Gives the investor the ability/option to “seed” some corporate culture - the high cost will represent the cost of all parties to the endeaver
        but the commission isn't "wrong" - the agent is paid based on product sold, not as a % of the startup - takes away an economic gain for the agent on a large startup (which hurts the company by taking it's opening money). This would probably
        be in the form of a % of invenstment incoming or % of company - or both, to do this type of pitch and hit.
        <br>The insurance product produces a more reasonable middle layer - with decent incentive to get sales based worksite people into the startup market helping them scheme business operations (not product development) - which is what these guys
        do

        fun

        <br>High income/population environments are examples of poeple looking to be involved in the technology and the startup economy, but their local environment in no way caters to the type of focus required to do well in this situation. Lets

        <br>We'll build a set of race cars (already made MVPs) they can "buy" and play with on "5 year" min contracts (with options to sell the team should the product fail, or buyout possibly, we'll see).
        <br>The focus being not only do they have a cool tech, american team, but they also used “delicious” to make sure they have a cool team (one they can visit and actually work with … it’s that kind of thing they could actually visit - a real

      <div class="rant-text">
        (blend / reprocess)
        A bit of background - I lived and worked on a farm during the summers as a kid. I believe blending work and family is the ancient and healthy way of life. Splitting families for work purposes is needed in war, but no other times in history.
        <br>Lets stop the war. I don’t believe a work environment should discourage family presence, quite the opposite, the work place needs to be adjust to compliment the current state of workers lives. This product delivers tools to assist teams
        in
        adhering to these principals. I was offered terrific opportunities entering the workforce in Lincoln, and I don’t think the same opportunities exist today - especially with regard to the culture. I want women to participate fully if not
        equally in all areas of product development at all ages.
        <br>The rate of innovation is forcing the gig economy - having people work for 2 or 4 hours at a time for only that pay has always been the corporations dream.
        <br>This product is about developer and investor brains fighting back - like minds will draw to this product from both sides - the cost of smaller markets makes this “family raising team” possible. While applying this sort of manipulation
        long
        term to a product team doesn’t make sense, to encourage participation of both sexes at an entry level to participate in these types of companies, exceptional considerations are taken for a “short” ~5 year period. Most people care greatly
        about the social and aesthetic aspect of the workplace, especially early in their career.
        <br>This product will be best consumed at the angel investment round ($3million + 5 year small team salary insurance, as the team grows the length of insurance decreases). Refer to company example, team make up, product description - while
        candidate company (or product team from a larger company) can be flexible, there are a workable number of companies that meet this limited criteria.
        <br>
        From when I was young - the richest and most successful people didn’t look at how much they made per hour, they were always thinking about how to keep every dollar or grain they could in their eco-system. By getting the load of the local
        eco-system payments, it maintains a local feel that equates to handing someone cash directly. On the other hand, it also removes the trouble a developer would take to run out and deliver the cash - but due to the “nature” of not losing
        nutrients in the eco-system people resist payment systems, but then resist local transactions because of the trouble of a personal contact.
      </div>
      <div class="rant-header">WHY MANIPULATE MARKET</div>
      <div class="rant-text">
        Technology is advancing in such a way that it makes product, software and branding work easier to reuse across cultures and markets - the misbalances in cost require adjustments in higher income markets to effectively compete
        <br>This is a different age, people aren’t going to work as much or as long, but I believe when they do work, they’re going to work hard and for reasons other money alone
        <br>People (esp female) who play should get a first class seat on the bus - not get demoted in rank for it.
        <br>The idea here is since pricing in local markets aren’t even market to market anyways, lets set some rules for the local market to introduce some culture in this product feature race (which is national).
