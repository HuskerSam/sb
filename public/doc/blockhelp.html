  <h1>Blocks, Linked Blocks and Frames</h1>
  The concept of a block is to be a virtual lego block - with a specified size such as 2x4 or 1x8, etc. Then a scene and animation is built from a collection of blocks.
  <br>
  <br> Blocks are containers holding members in the form of meshes, shapes and other blocks. Blocks are rendered as a box mesh containing all of the child elements. The isVisible of the box is set to false, leaving the child elements visible, but not
  the block wrapper. Scaling, position and rotation are fully animatable features of a block - not color, visibility though. While materials can be applied to an entire block, animating the materials is not possible.
  The block root contains frames, when it's a child you can choose either to these frames, or override (default) them with new ones.
  <br>
  ... to add - inherit material, follow camera example, skybox and ground, block dimensions
  <br>

  <h1 id="meshes">Meshes and Shapes</h1>
  Meshes can be difficult to export from blender and import.  If you see red lines in the console (from images missing) - these textures can be removed by
  opening the .babylon file and removing them.  Just empty the path and leave "".  Try to keep the mesh in one piece, otherwise once imported you'll have to wrap it in a
  block to size it, etc and lose some of the native abilities.  Try to delete as many other objects out of the blender scene as possible, so only the mesh is left.  The
  import routine grabs the first mesh it finds coming in from the .babylon file (scene).
  <br>
  Once a mesh is loaded, use the [Fit] button to size it so you can see it, by default this will place the mesh in 1x1x1 box and you can size it from there.

  <h2>Animation Length</h2>
  The outer most block controls the animation length, all internal blocks will repeat.  So for a 30s animation, the root block should have at least one frame with a time of 30s.

  The application generates a first frame here, and the last frame is 30s as specified by the time.
  <br>
  <h2>Clone Previous Frame</h2>
  The example below shows the use of the cp operator for time.  Also times by default are in ms, but 20s = 20000, m also works for minutes.
  The cp (clone previous) operator clones the previous frame and sets the time (in this case 1 ms before).  This creates an instant
  transition without coding the duplicate frame (it's just save you the time of entering 2 frames instead of one). As you can see from the data
  below the data 2 rows results - the blue one is from the cp operator.

  <br>
  <h2>Relative + and ++ operators</h2>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hcwebflow/himage/framesrelativeops.jpg" style="float:left;" />
  The + prefix operator adds the value to the first frame value to determine the current frame value.
  The ++ operator adds the value to the previous frame.
  The example at the left shows 2000 starting time, the 2nd frame has an absolute time (3.5s).  The third
  frame adds 2500 to the first frame time to get 4500 - and the last frame adds 500 to the previous frame for 5000.

  <div style="clear:both"></div>
  <h2>* operator (parent time offset)</h2>
  The * operator will find the first user created frame from the parent block and add it's time to this frame.  This is used to move an entire
  block in time, for example a bouncing ball as a block can be started at 5s or 10s, and all animations underneath can the be
  timed with relative operators so the same block can be moved in both position/scale/rotation and time.
  <h2>% operator (time only)</h2>
  The length of the animation is determined by the frames on the root block.  Any frames related to child blocks can have
  a time based as a % of animation length as a whole.
  <br>
  <h2>Easing functions</h2>
  3 easing functions are provided, ease in (ei), ease out (eo) and ease in and out (eio).  You can use these by specifying on the first frame using a colon;
  <br>
  i.e. 0s:eio  1000:ei

  <h2>Last Frame and First Frame generation</h2>
  If you enter a time in the first raw frame, the system will automatically generate a frame at time 0.  This freezes the object in place until this time.

  If you append lf to the last frame, a last frame will be generated with a time equal to the last frame of the root animation.  This way if you
  move an object and want it to stay for the rest of the animation, add lf to it's time, i.e.  10slf  or 5500lf.
