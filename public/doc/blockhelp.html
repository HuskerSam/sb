  <h1>Blocks, Linked Blocks and Frames</h1>
  The concept of a block is to be a virtual lego block - with a specified size such as 2x4 or 1x8, etc. Then a scene and animation is built from a collection of blocks.
  <br>
  <br> Blocks are containers holding members in the form of meshes, shapes and other blocks. Blocks are rendered as a box mesh containing all of the child elements. The isVisible of the box is set to false, leaving the child elements visible, but not
  the block wrapper. Scaling, position and rotation are fully animatable features of a block - not color, visibility though. While materials can be applied to an entire block, animating the materials is not possible.
  The block root contains frames, when it's a child you can choose either to these frames, or override (default) them with new ones.
  <br>
  ... to add - inherit material, follow camera example, skybox and ground, block dimensions
  <br>

  <h1 id="meshes">Meshes and Shapes</h1>
  Meshes can be difficult to export from blender and import.  If you see red lines in the console (from images missing) - these textures can be removed by
  opening the .babylon file and removing them.  Just empty the path and leave "".  Try to keep the mesh in one piece, otherwise once imported you'll have to wrap it in a
  block to size it, etc and lose some of the native abilities.  Try to delete as many other objects out of the blender scene as possible, so only the mesh is left.  The
  import routine grabs the first mesh it finds coming in from the .babylon file (scene).
  <br>
  Once a mesh is loaded, use the [Fit] button to size it so you can see it, by default this will place the mesh in 1x1x1 box and you can size it from there.
