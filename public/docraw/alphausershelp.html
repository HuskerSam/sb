<h2>Deployed Project Persistence</h2>
handtopbuilder/builder will be cleared often - use one of the other servers listed in the deploy options template if you want some longer persistence.

<h2>Data Ownership / Terms</h2>
We have no intention of claiming any rights to any of your media or profiting from it.  On the other hand
we own everything that we originate especially code and techniques.  <b>ABSOLUTELY don't go to scale</b>, over $100 and GCP
demands payment at end of the week - I'm poor and big surprise bills suck bad.  If you want to publish something, just ask
and it's easy to get something served up in an instant - on your billing account. <br>

<h2>Spreadsheet Considerations</h2>
<h3>% based values in cells</h3>
% based values are useful when working with frame times - be careful to either add a "'"
to the front i.e. 98% = '98%, or 98% = ="98%" in the cell. Otherwise sheets calcs 98% = .98 - which equates to .98 ms.
<b>under consideration</b> is converting a raw value of  0 - 1 into a % (value / 100).  1 shouldn't really be used as
3-5 is better - @30 frames a second, it's 3ms + per frame.  So possibly .1 = 10% (instead of .1ms), 1 = 100% (instead of 1ms) and 0 is 0.
<h3>Sheets Timeouts</h3>
functions must finish in 30 seconds or they fail - this at busy times of
day (afternoon/evening USA) can cause intermitent fails - so check formula results and try again at times to make sure no errors
<h3>Addon Refresh Times</h3>
Please be patient with the add for best results, wait until the green uploading/deploying/refreshing data
is done to navigate and change values - we know it's slow it likely always will be
<h3>Special Characters in names</h3>
Try not to use commas (,) or other special characters in names (/, http, etc) as it may cause errors due to
CSV format (unlikely if you stick to the templates) but also macros, sometimes textures are generated from
color: and http: prefixes to simplify material description
<h2>Features in Progress For Release</h2>
<h3>preset basket position and sizes</h3>
so selected items appear "in cart" in a pre defined (and better) way - similar to product positions - this would be basket positions
<h3>get instancing to work</h3>
when it's the same mesh in multiple child blocks - and no scaling is used (possibly use a flag at the block (or block child) level that hides/diables frame scaling
<br>
an instance flag on the block child record could force the mesh/shape to use an "instance" cache for all items in the animation (not just the current block) - the scale settings would come from the mesh/shape record
<h3>use a ghost block</h3>
when picking an item on local device for motion and scaling?
<br>
iterate away from changing the animation and use user profile and ghost blocks for user specific variations (i.e. cart should be full of ghost blocks - also use ghost blocks when picking an item)
<h3>fixup login on /asset so it caches credentials</h3>
<h3>remove music generation data after frames generated</h3>
(also provide option other then scaling to make it usable on mobile - such as a shaking rotation)
<h3>popup confirmation of data copied to clipboard</h3>
(like aws)
<h3>audio support for /view</h3>
<h3>Saved Camera Updates</h3>
investigate saved camera with default camera in /view, and also default arcrotate camera in /display for the move buttons
<h3>add fragments, assets and products to template preview</h3>
just info in the detail panel in addon
<h3>Group for support</h3>
<h4>Consistent but anonymous names</h4>
<h4>In general able to share question and answer - but all personal and company
  reference is removed.  Privacy first.  No one likes being the search engine at all,
  especially not 10 years from now.  Lets keep you out throughout.
<h3>GIFs supported in G Suite display - upgrade the image with some frames</h3>

<br><br><br>
<h2>next release / need more thought</h2>
<h3>/asset - add open material new window</h3>
to make it easy to open and drill down into materials
<h3>realtime editable experience near homepage? like logo editor???</h3>
<h3>need to created texture for /product/product_chips.babylon</h3>
<h3>Meter based units - unit factors</h3>
add cm operator for spatial units? would 1/100 multiplier to convert to meters as a base unit (like ms for time)
<h3>refactor frames data to be children of blockchild records - deprecate frames collection</h3>
pre firestore conversion for sure
<h3>mesh/texture preview in 3d</h3>
for addon? (vs saved preview image)
<br>
maybe /preview that fast generates texture/mat/mesh and shows?
<br>autofit
<br>shape preview with realtime adjustments?
<h3>Mesh Wizard Import updates</h3>
Support scaling, position and rotation defaults - mostly for default scaling to
convert all sizes into meters for maximum VR compatibility
<h3>.glb export updates</h3>
(raw color problem) - convert the color: values to an inline embedded images for export data: ...
<h3>color picker for message type on product positioning</h3>

<h3>Text, Shape and Arrow</h3>
like text and shape - for diagraming - easy to connect arrow (connector line) to other shapes

<h3>Service Worker for 3D Text</h3>
Kick off a thread to generate 3D text - load one or two in parallel to main thread and have them generate 3D
Text and transfer the result to main thread when complete

<h3>Copy Link for new spreadsheet for template</h3>
in help item provide a open new that creates a sheets doc and allows the user to make a copy
with the template generated in it

<h3>Molecule plotter</h3>
Sphere(shape) plotter for positions, sizes, colors and connections - will plot
spheres at the positions, scale and color them, then connect line (cylinders)
point to point to form lines that can be wrapped into molecules (colors and size
for various atoms)

<h3>Parallax scrolling interface - where the user scrolls a "follow ui" type of interface,
  but the follow is control via scroll ... similar to a parallax UI for a carousel interface</h3>
