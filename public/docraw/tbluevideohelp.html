Second in a series of related examples.<br>
This builds on the Short Red Video Tutorial.  The result data
from the previous example is used to create a reusable block and
share it with another scene.

<h2>Tutorial Steps</h2>
<h3>Clone result from Red Video Tutorial</h3>
If you did the previous tutorial, you can start from the result, otherwise
import the red tutorial to create the single sheet (but long) recipe.
<h3>Create a new sheet and transfer rows</h3>
Lets reuse the animated shapes (and container block) by extracting them
into a separate sheet that's easy to reuse.<br>
The result sheet can be created by importing the "Spheres for Videos" template (Assets)<br>
The green and yellow videos are generated using the same process<br>
