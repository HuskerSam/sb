Install the addon requests permission to access spreadsheets (edit, create, etc) - but not "list" the spreadsheets.
Features of the addon allow spreadsheets to access ranges in other spreadsheets with functions.  While the addon
has the capability to edit any spreadsheet your account has access too, it does NOT have the ability to lookup/list/find
any spreadsheet id without you providing it (outside of the addon functionality).
