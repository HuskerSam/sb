<h2>Deployed Project Persistence</h2>
handtopbuilder/builder will be cleared often so it doesn't build up with junk<br>
Please use one of the other servers in the list if you want some longer persistence.
<h2>Data Ownership</h2>
Data created is "mostly" our property, your pictures, meshes and other data you upload is yours
and your responsibility, we have no intention of claiming any rights to any of your media
 or profiting from it.
<h2>% based values in cells</h2>
% based values are useful when working with frame times - be careful to either add a "'"
to the front i.e. 98% = '98%, or 98% = ="98%" in the cell. Otherwise sheets calcs 98% = .98 - which equates to .98 ms.
<h2>Sheets Timeouts</h2>
functions must finish in 60 seconds or they fail - this at busy times of
 day (afternoon/evening USA) can cause intermitent fails - so check formula results and try again at times to make sure no errors
<h2>Addon Refresh Times</h2>
Please be patient with the add for best results, wait until the green uploading/deploying/refreshing data
 is done to navigate and change values - we know it's slow it likely always will be<br>
<h2>Special Characters in names</h2>
Try not to use commas (,) or other special characters in names (/, http, etc) as it may cause errors
