<h2>Text and Shape</h2>

<br>
This block creation helper combines 1 or 2 lines of text to make a shape combined with text. This is intended to replace a 2D square or circle containing text. It's not a good idea to have too many characters in one animation - as the poly count
can get high fast.
<br> For the materials, you can either use a <a href="#materials">material</a> you have created, or you can use "color: 1,1,1" notation to specify a color as the material.
For the shape, pick one of the presets, size it and the text and shape will be generated and placed into a box. The shape will be positioned on the negative Z axis, centered on Y and X. The text will be placed on the positive Z axis.
<h3>Shape and Text Notes</h3>
Spaces count for centering, to push left, add spaces at end of text, in front of text to slide text right

<h2>Connector Line</h2>

This block creation helper combines 3 shapes into a block to form a connector line. A cylinder shape is used for the line - if you don't want it round, specify the number of div (min 3), i.e. 4 makes a box instead of a cylinder.

<h2>Animated Line</h2>

<br>
This block creation helper combines shapes into a container block and adds frames. To make the dashes move faster, decrease the Run Time, or increase the D (Depth) of the line. Use these in place of dashed lines or to show flow.
