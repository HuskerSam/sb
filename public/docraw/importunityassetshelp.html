<h1>Buy and import assets from the Unity Store</h1>
<h2>Import process is similar for importing any asset</h2>
Most meshes as stored as .fbx format (Maya/Autodesk) or .glb/.gtlf - but you will also find some
.obj (wavefront) and a few other formats.  Try to purchase assets created and/or updated in the last
year or two - they tend to have lower poly counts and perform much better in general.

To convert meshes to babylon format - we'll use <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/" target="_blank">Blender</a>
and the Blender plugin for Babylon - <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/extensions/Exporters/Blender" target="_blank">Babylonjs Blender Plugin</a>
- make sure to check the box after importing to enable the plugin.
<br>
If the textures are not already baked, consider using Ian Dean's Mesh Baker plugin for Unity - costs about 30 bucks<br>
<br>
In Blender you can delete objects by clicking on them and pressing the [del] key.

Clean the hierarchy down to only the mesh you want to export - the export tool exports a scene
of which the first mesh in the scene is loaded into babylonjs

Import the mesh into scene builder to adjust the scale - sometimes things are very small (when in meters)
or very large when in mm or inches.<br>

<br>
Import the material<br>
First we need to convert the images to either png (if transparency is needed, or is small anyways) or jpg
for large images where we need lossy compression to save space.
<br>
<a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> is recommended but use your favorite editor.  In the picture
below when you see a 4 color channel called alpha, it's probably best to export to png if it's the base texture - transparency
only applies to the base (or albedo texture) - otherwise jpg is almost always better - these texture files tend to be
very large and reducing their size is critical to fast download performance.  If a file is small save it as a png so there
is no loss - but anything over 100kb will be greatly reduced (usually) in jpg vs png.

The emissive texture is used for both spectral and emissive - as the spectral texture is very very
large in these models and the emissive does "good enough" without the huge size.<br>

The addon wizard can now be used to create the rows<br>

To get things to work switch around the emissive, spectral, ambient and diffuse textures - at times you'll get
a result that is better after conversion - and try to eliminate large files that are for spectral or emissive only
and use the diffuse or the smaller of the s/e for both.  Keeping the size small is very important in imported
assets, and they usually contain 5 or 6 texture files at time - which can all be used but keep each item
2-5mb max size - think of 10 objects at 2M or 5M = 20-50mb.  That's a chunky download.  10mb is a strong target
for a quick experience, 30 mb for a longer experience.  Above this and they need wifi and a bigger screen
to really see things.

Usually assets in one package are very similar, once you decide which images and textures to use, formats,
scaling and front direction - it's the same for all the assets in the package.
