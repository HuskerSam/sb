<h2>Virtual Lego Block</h2>
The concept of a block is to be a virtual lego block -
with a specified size such as 2x4 or 1x8, etc.  Scenes and animation are built from blocks and frames.
<h3>Block Children</h3>
<h4>Blocks have Block Children</h4>
<h4>Block Children have Frames</h4>
<h4>Blocks must be created before creating Block Children</h4>
<h4>Block Children must be created before creating Frames</h4>
Blocks are containers holding members in the form of meshes, shapes and other blocks. Blocks are rendered as a box mesh containing all of the child elements. The isVisible of the box is set to false, leaving the child elements visible, but not
the block wrapper. Scaling, position and rotation are fully animatable features of a block - not color, visibility though. While materials can be applied to an entire block, animating the materials is not possible.
The block root contains frames, when it's a child you can choose either to these frames, or override (default) them with new ones.
In many ways a block is similar to a DIV element in HTML.  Blocks can be used to
carry data in the field genericBlockData and marked for special purposes using the blockFlag field.
<br>
<b>blockchild</b> - [parent] relates to title of parent block, parent must exist
<br> &nbsp; [materialname] = 'inherit' sets (inheritMaterial) = true
<br> &nbsp; [childtype](childType) - shape, mesh, camera, light, block
<br> &nbsp; [childname](childName) - title/name of Linked Asset - linked asset can be created later

<h3>Macro Blocks</h3>
<h4>Scene Blocks</h4>
Blocks contain a number of features that only apply when they are the root block in a project.
When a block is used as a root block it will generate a default camera and light - which can be specified.
Audio, video and animation length are some of the scene level settings a block can contain.

<h4>Diagram Blocks</h4>
These are to support flow charting and diagramming pursuits.

<h4>Display Blocks</h4>
These support product positioning and picking.

<h3>Special Purpose Fields</h3>
<h4>Display Support</h4>
(block::blockFlag) = "scene" - root block for the generated scene and assets/links
<br>(block::blockFlag) = "basket" - selected item basket block
<br>(block::blockFlag) = "displaypositions" - preset list of positions for items; genericblockdata = "x1||y1||z1||rx1||ry1||rz1||x2||y2..."
<br>(block::blockFlag) = "displayfieldedits" - override fields in the layout/scene template; genericblockdata = "displaytitle||$template|| $assetName||$assetType|| $fieldname1:$fieldtype1|| $fieldname2:$fieldtype2..."
<br> &nbsp; $template - layout/product/asset; $assetName - [name]; $assetType - [asset]; $fieldtype - [csv column name]; $fieldtype - display type (image,num)
<br>(block::blockFlag) = "displayblock" - tags block for matching to sku/itemid based items
<br>(block::supportvr) = "1" - enables webXR support for headsets - buggy browsers - works on Quest 2 for sure

<h4>asset = block</h4>
row for a block asset
<br>basic fields - [materialname], [height], [width], [depth]
<br>[blockcode] (blockCode) - lookup field (legacy field, blockFlag should be used now)
<br>[blockflag] (blockFlag) - field flagging block as special case
<br>[genericblockdata] (genericblockdata) - import data (i.e. hashed position list)
<h3>Other Macro Blocks</h3>
<h4>textplane</h4>
 a row for texture and shape (plane) assets showing fitted/sized 2D text
<br> &nbsp; [width, height, depth] - determine size
<br> &nbsp; [texturetext, texturetext2] - line 1 and 2 of text
<br> &nbsp; [textfontfamily, textfontcolor, textfontsize, textfontweight] - html/css font fields
<br> &nbsp; [texturetextrendersize] - 512 by default - the width of the container the text is rendered in
<h4>Web Font</h4>
- link and use <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">web fonts</a>
<h3>Import Notes</h3>
document csv import object overwrite by name/title - todo on block - when overwriting a block also delete the block children and frames which are orphaned
should be low usage - so orphans should be of min concern, and they should be very small in size
