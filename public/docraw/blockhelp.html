<h1>Blocks, Linked Blocks and Frames</h1>
The concept of a block is to be a virtual lego block - with a specified size such as 2x4 or 1x8, etc. Then a scene and animation is built from a collection of blocks.
<br>
<br> Blocks are containers holding members in the form of meshes, shapes and other blocks. Blocks are rendered as a box mesh containing all of the child elements. The isVisible of the box is set to false, leaving the child elements visible, but not
the block wrapper. Scaling, position and rotation are fully animatable features of a block - not color, visibility though. While materials can be applied to an entire block, animating the materials is not possible.
The block root contains frames, when it's a child you can choose either to these frames, or override (default) them with new ones.
<br>
... to add - inherit material, follow camera example, skybox and ground, block dimensions
<br>
<br>
<b>Important notes</b><br>
Blocks must existing before adding block children (not late/loose bound) - the block to blockchild to block/shape/mesh/camera/light is related with internal IDs.
<br>
Same rule with frames, the block, and block child must exist - as the frames are internally related to block children.

<h1 id="blockdiagrams">3D Block Diagrams</h1> There are 3 add helpers for quickly building diagrams.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Scene Block (sceneblock)</h2>
<br>
Default Camera (displaycamera): camera name to use by default
<br>
audiourl: url to html5 compatible song (mpg, wav, etc)
<br>
frametime: length of animation if frames included for any blocks - this is <b>required to have a play button</b>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Text and Shape</h2>
<div style="float:left;">
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hcwebflow/himage/textandshapeexample.png" style="width:200px" />
</div>
This block creation helper combines 1 or 2 lines of text to make a shape combined with text. This is intended to replace a 2D square or circle containing text. It's not a good idea to have too many characters in one animation - as the poly count
can get
high fast. <br>
<br> For the materials, you can either use a <a href="#materials">material</a> you have created, or you can use "color: 1,1,1" notation to specify a color as the material.
<br>
<br> For the shape, pick one of the presets, size it and the text and shape will be generated and placed into a box. The shape will be positioned on the negative Z axis, centered on Y and X. The text will be placed on the positive Z axis.
<br>
<div style="clear:both"></div>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Connector Line</h2>
<div style="float:left;">
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hcwebflow/himage/connectorlineexample.jpg" style="width:200px" />
</div>
This block creation helper combines 3 shapes into a block to form a connector line. A cylinder shape is used for the line - if you don't want it round, specify the number of div (min 3), i.e. 4 makes a box instead of a cylinder.

<h2>Animated Line</h2>
<div style="float:left;">
  <video width="200" autoplay loop>
    <source src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hcwebflow/videos/animatedline.webm" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</div>
This block creation helper combines shapes into a container block and adds frames. To make the dashes move faster, decrease the Run Time, or increase the D (Depth) of the line. Use these in place of dashed lines or to show flow.

Shape and Text Notes<br>
Spaces count for centering, to push left, add spaces at end of text, in front of text to slide text right
