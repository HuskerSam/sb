create new firebase project - this results in a {FIREBASEPROJECTID} - you can also bind a url to this
<br><br>
create Realtime Database instance - this is the main database at this time
<br><br>
Authentication - enable anonymous - this is for /view and /display<br>
also enable Google - this is for /asset<br>
also enable email/passwordless - this is for /asset<br>
-- only enable anonymous for production - recommended at this time - to prevent /asset access 
<br><br>
create firestore instance (select region - will also create bucket storage) - this is only for configuration but will be the main database in a later release
<br><br>
add to firestore privateConfiguration->security->token: "{TOKENVALUE}"
<br><br>
the {TOKENVALUE} (you set it) and the Firebase proejct id will be the 2 values needed for the addon
<br>
<br>
turn on billing / blaze plan to support cloud functions
<br>
<br>
upload the code (fetch from github) - hosting only first
<br>
 firebase deploy -P {FIREBASEPROJECTID} --only hosting
<br>
  &nbsp; this is needed as site files are used in the server and need to be in the cloud when deployed initially
  <br>
  then deploy <br>
firebase deploy -P {FIREBASEPROJECTID}
<br>
 &nbsp; --only functions is possible but the hosting deploy is very fast anyways and this will be the regular command that works
 <br><br>
to test deploy the web logo example using addon - FIREBASEPROJECTID and TOKENVALUE are the server credentials for addon
