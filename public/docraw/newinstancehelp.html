<h1>For Developers</h1>
<h2>Steps to create a new server instance</h2>
<h3>Create new firebase project</h3>
 - results in a {FIREBASEPROJECTID}<br>
 - you can also bind a url to this
<h3>Create Realtime Database</h3>
 - main database
<h3>Enable User Authentication</h3>
 - enable anonymous - this is for Asset Viewer (/view) and Display App (/display)<br>
 - enable Google - this is for Asset Manager (/asset); optional<br>
 - enable email/passwordless - this is for Asset Manager (/asset); optional<br>
 - only enable anonymous for production - recommended at this time - to prevent /asset access
 - another option is to only enable the Firebase default route - not a configured url for access
<h3>Create Firestore Instance</h3>
 - select region
 - will also create bucket storage
 - this is only for configuration but will be the main database in a later release
<h3>Initialize token for access</h3>
 - add to Firestore privateConfiguration->security->token: "{TOKENVALUE}"
 - the {TOKENVALUE} (you set it) and the Firebase Project id will be the 2 values needed for the addon
<h3>Enable billing</h3>
 - blaze plan to support cloud functions
<h3>Upload Code</h3>
  Code needs to be uploaded twice - once for hosting then a second time for cloud functions.  The cloud functions load
  some routines from the hosted website (javascript).
<br>
 firebase deploy -P {FIREBASEPROJECTID} --only hosting
<br>
firebase deploy -P {FIREBASEPROJECTID} --only functions
<h3>Configure CORS for bucket</h3>
<b>Important:</b> CORS headers need to be set on the google bucket associated with the project<br>
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cross-origin#Configuring-CORS-on-a-Bucket" target="_blank">GCP Reference</a>
<a href="https://handtop.com/docimages/cors.json" target="_blank">Example cors.json</a> - this file also lives in the code root directory.<br>
gcloud auth login<br>
 - then follow steps to authenticate (if needed)<br>
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://{FIREBASEPROJECTID}.appspot.com
<br> -- execute from directory where the cors.json file exists (or path this cmd better).
<br>
<h3>Enable backup for RTDB</h3>
If using the Asset Manager (/asset) to create content, it's recommended to enable daily backups on RTDB to prevent expected data loss.
