/display is an example of a customized client application.  /view is the default viewer, /display
is intended to hide the animation internals and expose user features in low intensity ways.
<br>
/display contains 4 interfaces for different situations
<br>
/display also contains features to change materials in realtime, chat in 3D in realtime/multiuser, etc
<br>
customized apps are meant to use a mix of features - probably not all - and additional ones specific to the client
