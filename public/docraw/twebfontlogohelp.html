This example includes a scene, a 3d text asset (shape) and a supporting block
to include a web font.  Meant to be simple and quick - with some notes
about cell editing.

<h2>Template Details</h2>
When creating a template (whether a reused sheet, or an internal template for the addon) it can
be useful to spruce up the UI with some color responsive functions.  This example uses
colorHeader, which is useful for watching one cell, and turning the background color accordingly
for a range of cells.  The color level is watched, and when it's too dark white is used in the
foreground of the cell.
