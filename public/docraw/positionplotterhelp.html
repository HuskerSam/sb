<h2>Plots sets of coordinates for plots and paths</h2>
<h3>Bar Chart Plotter</h3>
Simple, provides example of uniform position data
to position rows of shapes and meshes

<h3>Radial Plotter</h3>
<h4>plots circles, ellipses and spirals</h4>
height: use it for a spiral effect - 0 produces a set of points with no rise<br>
end depth, end width: leave blank to match width, 0 creates spiral effect<br>
turns: number of times to circle - useful with height - otherwise points are plotted over the same path on the same plane (probably repeats without decay)
<br>
decay: % of points reduced per turn (~row), for example 3 turns with 50% decay - bottom row 12 pts, 2nd row 6 points, 3rd row 3 points<br>
<br>
<b>To Gain More Precision</b> multiply the width/height/depth by 10, 100, 1000 as needed and use cell formulas to scale back down<br>

<h3>Path Plotter</h3>
Used for pathing cart motion, where the cart moves in an angled direction and rotates
only near a point - i.e. moving around in shopping isles.
