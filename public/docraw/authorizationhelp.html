For /view and /display apps, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth" target="_blank">Firebase Anonymous Authorization</a>
is used with a single profile for all users during alpha to increase multiple user overlap.<br>
For /asset Google authorization or email (passwordless) is used.  You are prompted to login each time because we can't save 2 sets
of Firebase Auth credentials for one domain, so /view and /display authorization is preferred by default over /asset.  In production for
a client we can use sub domains to store more credentials, so asset can become asset.sitename.com vs www.sitename.com and store separate credentials
that don't overwrite the user applications.

Addon security is performed using a token stored in RTDB and passed to an API.
