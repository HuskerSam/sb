<h3>Baking textures results in one set of files for an entire model/mesh</h3>
<h4>Multiple meshes can also be baked into one mesh</h4>
This is used to reduce complexity, and can be used to reduce file sizes (and quality).
The resulting output can be rolled into a .glb or used in native .babylon mesh files -
and texture files can used as is in the .glb or with the mesh in any resulting format
for any system.
<h4>Unity and packages needed</h4>
Ian Deane's Mesh Baker (and texture baker) - <a target="_blank" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/mesh-baker-5017">Unity Store ~ $40</a>
<br>
FBX Export (free from Unity) - <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.formats.fbx@2.0/manual/index.html">Unity Store - free</a>
<br>
<br>
The texture baker has lots and lots of options - which we will mostly ignore and use it's default
setup - which will generally work well for most cases converting models for use on the web.
<br>
FBX is the most regular format for meshes and models - Unity, Blender and Autodesk all
inter operate well using FBX formats - and Blender is the best place to go from FBX to
BabylonJS.
<h2>The recipe!</h2>
<h3>Select, download and import a package of models from Unity</h3>
Please download and import the 3 packages (FBX export, Ian Deane's Texture Baker and the package of assets you want to work with).
<br>

<br>
Using the Search field to filter can help<br>
Find the FBX Export in the 'Unity Registry' - not 'My Assets'<br>
<img alt="Filter Assets" src="https://handtop.com/docimages/unityimportmeshbaker.png">
<br>
Next add a meshbaker object to your project<br>
<img alt="Add Mesh Baker" src="https://handtop.com/docimages/unityaddtexturebaker.png">
<br>
Next add an object from "Prefabs" (versus models - these tend to be only the mesh here)<br>
Also zero the coords to 0,0,0 (optional)<br>
Keep this as the only object in the project (for later when we export)<br>

<br>
<h3>After baking and exporting a model</h3>
It's best to delete the generated material (and all associated files)
  from the directory, and also delete the generated object in the unity project, the texture baker object
  and the original fabrication generated object.  This will create much more consistent results.

<br>
<br>
If [Bake Materials Into Combined Material] doesn't produce results, try clicking the [Blend Non-Texture Properies] checkbox.

<h2>Try not to include small details</h2>
Things like door knobs, TV screens (detail) - can greatly increase the size of a mesh and texture set.
At times, try to remove a key part that can be added back - so the main item is one color/material -
otherwise the baked texture set gets megabytes big instead of kilobytes.
