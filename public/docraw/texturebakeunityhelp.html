<h3>Baking textures results in one set of files for an entire model/mesh</h3>
<h4>Multiple meshes can also be baked into one mesh</h4>
This is used to reduce complexity, and can be used to reduce file sizes (and quality).
The resulting output can be rolled into a .glb or used in native .babylon mesh files -
and texture files can used as is in the .glb or with the mesh in any resulting format
for any system.
<h4>Unity and packages needed</h4>
Ian Deane's Mesh Baker (and texture baker) - <a target="_blank" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/mesh-baker-5017">Unity Store ~ $40</a>
<br>
FBX Export (free from Unity) - <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.formats.fbx@2.0/manual/index.html">Unity Store - free</a>
<br>
<br>
The texture baker has lots and lots of options - which we will mostly ignore and use it's default
setup - which will generally work well for most cases converting models for use on the web.
<br>
FBX is the most regular format for meshes and models - Unity, Blender and Autodesk all
inter operate well using FBX formats - and Blender is the best place to go from FBX to
BabylonJS.
<h2>The recipe!</h2>
<h3>Select, download and import a package of models from Unity</h3>
Please download and import the 3 packages (FBX export, Ian Deane's Texture Baker and the package of assets you want to work with).

<br>
Using the Search field to filter can help<br>
Find the FBX Export in the 'Unity Registry' - not 'My Assets'<br>

<br>
Next add a meshbaker object to your project<br>
<img alt="Add Mesh Baker" src="https://handtop.com/docimages/unityaddtexturebaker.png">
<br>
Next add an object from "Prefabs" (versus models - these tend to be only the mesh here)<br>
Also zero the coords to 0,0,0 (optional)<br>
Keep this as the only object in the project (for later when we export)<br>
