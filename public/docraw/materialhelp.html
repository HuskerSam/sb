<h2>Bump Textures</h2>
Bump textures (aka normal maps) allow the gpu to render more light effects from a rough surface, without adding to the poly count.
Babylon has a little more reference: <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/more_materials">here</a>.
<br>
A number of bump textures (normal maps) are supplied for ease of use.
Check out the images prefixed with "sb: bmp-".
<h2>Text Based Color Macros</h2>
rgb (0-1 levels) color, use the format "color:r,g,b" - i.e. "color:1,0,0" is diffuse red, for emissive color, use "ecolor:1,0,0", to set both use "decolor:1,0,0"
<br> &nbsp; for textures there is an image library available using the prefix "sb: 123.jpg"

<br>
To view normal maps in the addon, leave the diffuse texture field blank - to view specular maps leave both the texture and bump map empty

<h2>Import Notes</h2>
on Import any texture name containing a "/" or "." is considered a file path and converted to a texture with scale and
considers .mp4 or .webm files as videos (sets texture as such), .png and .svg to contain hasAlpha = true in the texture
<br>hasalpha (csv) force sets the hasAlpha flag on the diffuse texture (alpha flag is only meaningful on diffuse)
<br><br>
offsetv, offsetu, scaleu, scalev are all applied to generated textures - for all textures - it's assumed if you scale or offet the diffuse map, all other maps will need the same alignment
