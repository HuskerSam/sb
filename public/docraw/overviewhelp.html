<h3>Deploy once, run everywhere</h3>
<h3>Realtime data intersects users and platforms instantly</h3>
Our platform integrates <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank">BabylonJS</a> 3D library with
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> hosting and data
for all javascript webGL/webXR delivered experiences.

An <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/handtop/453466452088" target="_blank">addon for Google Sheets</a>
simplifies deploying and editing mulitiple projects on multiple servers.
<br>
Our goal is to make editing 3D animations and displays as similar to editing DIVs and key frames in CSS.

<h3>webGL Scene Viewer Applications</h3>
Multiple applications are included by default for editing and viewing animations - end clients will likely customize
the code with special features. This system is a rapid 3D prototype with code customization
via applications to finish off performance intensive features - such as complex user interactions.

<h3>Google Sheets Based Addon</h3>
Create short shelf life applications via worksheets. Once the spreadsheet
data is setup to create an animation, making a series of small and regular adjustments, such as
changing images, text or colors; should be low intensity activities, including deployment and viewing
the deployed work product.

<h3>Catalog Displays</h3>
Importing data is broken up into three collections, assets, layout (or scene or circuit) and products.
The format of data is the same for all three files, the key is they are imported
assets first, layout second and products third, then the server performs a generate
display operation on the project data.
