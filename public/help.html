  <h1>Intro</h1> This application is written using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for the hosting and realtime data features.
  <a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/">Babylon.js</a> is used for the WebGL functionality, and their documentation is the technical reference to the animation functionality. This application targets rapidly developing scenes for consumption by javascript
  applications. Where features and functionality are quicker or easier to perform in code, they're left to be done there. That being said, for simple things like flowcharting and small animated videos this tool should do fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1 id="blockdiagrams">3D Block Diagrams</h1> There are 3 add helpers for quickly building diagrams.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Text and Shape</h2>
  <div style="float:left;">
    <img src="images/textandshapedialog.png" style="width:200px" />
    <br>
    <img src="images/textandshapeexample.png" style="width:200px" />
  </div>
  This block creation helper combines 1 or 2 lines of text to make a shape combined with text. This is intended to replace a 2D square or circle containing text. It's not a good idea to have too many characters in one animation - as the poly count can get high fast. <br>
  <br> For the materials, you can either use a <a href="#materials">material</a> you have created, or you can use "color: 1,1,1" notation to specify a color as the material.
  <br>
  <br> For the shape, pick one of the presets, size it and the text and shape will be generated and placed into a box. The shape will be positioned on the negative Z axis, centered on Y and X. The text will be placed on the positive Z axis.
  <br>
  <div style="clear:both"></div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Connector Line</h2>
  <div style="float:left;">
    <img src="images/connectorlinedialog.jpg" style="width:200px" />
    <br>
    <img src="images/connectorlineexample.jpg" style="width:200px" />
  </div>
  This block creation helper combines 3 shapes into a block to form a connector line.  A cylinder shape is used for the
  line - if you don't want it round, specify the number of div (min 3), i.e. 4 makes a box instead of a cylinder.

  <div style="clear:both"></div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Animated Line</h2>
  <div style="float:left;">
    <img src="images/animatedlinedialog.jpg" style="width:200px" />
    <br>
    <video width="200" autoplay loop>
      <source src="images/animatedline.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video>
  </div>
  This block creation helper combines shapes into a container block and adds frames.  To make the dashes move faster, decrease the
  Run Time, or increase the D (Depth) of the line.  Use these in place of dashed lines or to show flow.
