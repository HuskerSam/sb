    <b>WebGL product picker service</b> - import products via CSV format for a 3D user experience
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Fast is important</b> - fast loads, fast orders, fast updates, and fast ROI
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Our Motto</b> - More code costs more now and later! (aka KISS)
    <br>
    <b>Key Technique</b> - Data Driven Design
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Annual Plan</b> - 20 Demos and 6 MVPs from 3 teams
    <br>
    <b>Location</b> - local resources in Nebraska as possible, remote resources where expertise preferred/budgeted
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Demo</b> - a <a href="http://www.pretotyping.org/" target="_blank">pretotype</a> for designing the potential MVP ~ 1 week
    <br>
    <b>Prototype</b> - data integrated but 3D Content, UX and UI work remain ~ 3 weeks
    <br>
    <b>MVP(Minimum Viable Product)</b> - a working product that should produce a ROI immediately ~ 2 months
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Scope Control</b> - resources are budgeted mostly for customizing appearance and data integration; not new features
    <br>
    <b>Focused Development</b> - spend your resources on the features specific to your product - not the newest technologies
    <br>
    <b>Use Firebase</b> - for a integrated realtime data, storage, authorization, hosting solution and standardized deploy process (dev ops)
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>We're Looking</b> - for people that not only dream of writing video games, but plan to at some point
    <br>
    <b>Work Here</b> - for expert guidance in developing WebGL based mobile applications
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Team Roster</b> - a manager/contact, an experienced javascript developer, 2-3 with a mix of webgl/3d modeling/html/javascript/integration
    <br>
