    <b>Who are we looking for?</b>
    <br> People that not only dream of writing video games, but plan to at some point.
    <br> While dreaming is ok, we much a prefer a do’er.
    <br> And of course javascript programmers that want to kick some ass - everyone does.
    <br>
    <b>What do we offer developers?</b>
    <br> We provide expert guidance for developing javascript and WebGL talent. We definitely don't know it all and will learn it with you.
    <br> We employ and rely on standardized technologies such as ES6, WebGL and HTML 5.
    <br> We use Firebase to provide a complete cloud based platform, including realtime data, storage, authorization and hosting.
    <br> We want to hire and develop Javascript talent, Firebase talent and WebGL talent.
    <br> We have money and will patiently work with people that work hard and try to get better.
    <br> WebGL content is very challenging with a decent learning curve - before rewards, we’ll work with you to get there.
    <br>
    <b>Skills</b>
    <br> Blender/Unity mesh conversion to babylon.
    <br> Dev Ops using Firebase database and storage rules, stored in projects/ Github, etc.
    <br> Create and manipulate raw json data as well as use model objects to process import data.
    <br> ES6/Node/HTML/MVC/REST required.
    <br>
    <b>Our Style</b> Our Motto: More code costs more now and later!
    <br> Key Technique: Data Driven Design (add and remove fields using data)
    <br> Existing Code Base, Process and Hosting: Firebase.
    <br> We work to keep the line count small. This costs less now and later.
    <br> - We avoid automated testing, use popular libraries and think through changes before creating code.
    <br> Big code sucks - it’s slow to change, takes longer to create.
    <br> We create products that we’re happy to work on later and take pride in others working on later.
