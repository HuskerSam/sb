    <h2 id="problemretailclosing">Stores are closing</h2>
    The gaps between retail stores, printed catalogs and eCommerce
    <br>
    People view arrangements in store<br>
    Retail closings have been ongoing and with Covid have accelerated.
    <h2 id="problemcatalogstrash">Printing and mailing</h2>
    Mailed circular advertisements and printed catalogs still filling mail boxes and trash bins.
    <br>
    Eliminate mailed catalogs
    - existing ecommerce sites look “nothing like” actual stores or mailed catalogs
    <br> Paperless is more common now then not.
    <h2 id="problemgap">Experience gap</h2>
    Existing eCommerce sites are 2D and lack the spatial arrangement and human touch that goes into retail displays, leaving a large gap between an in
    store experience and a website visit.
    <br> Retail stores price and convenience are losing ground versus eCommerce websites and applications, but the human touch with selecting and displaying products is still important with many categories of products.
    <h2 id="solutionvr">Virtual Reality cloud</h2>
    By offering a new option in between physical retail stores and eCommerce sites combining the spatial arrangement
    of products in a catalog and/or physical store location using Virtual Reality (on mobile first, but also other devices including
    console and headsets). It’s time to get more efficient on product presentation with eCommerce to offset the physical retail store collapse. At the same time representing products in arrangements and groups is a very common practice both in
    creating catalogs and retail store layouts.

    <br>
    Keeping assets in common and easy to convert formats (portable)***
    <h2 id="solutionpeople">No experience required</h2>
    Use low skilled people in Lincoln, Nebraska area that previously did phone support and/or retail store associates.
    <br>
    <h2 id="solutionmix">Blend into existing solutions</h2>
    <br> CSV data format for associating existing product catalog pipelines with 3D assets for Virtual Reality Display
    <br> Digital twins are just now being created for products, hosting these assets requires managing size, brightness and combinations (arrangements).



    <h2 id="opportunitytarget">Retail chains pivoting online</h2>
    <br> People visit retail stores to view products and layouts (displays). Most regular customers buy from stores on each visit out of appreciation for the retail selection and arrangement services.
    <br> People visit eCommerce stores to find the best price, availability and delivery options. There is still a large gap between these two activities, with the exception of high loyalty from retail stores transitioning to online stores.
    <br> Visual Catalogs (Virtual Reality based product display and picking) looks to fall somewhere
    in between current online offerings and vastly more expensive and disappearing retail store options.

    <br> While the overall market is large, our target market is retail chains that plan to mix fewer physical stores with more dynamic online options.

    <h2 id="opportunityhardware">Evolving user interfaces</h2>
    Our approach at this
    time is focused first on mobile, including using device orientation (Mild Orientation UI?) and animation (Follow UI?).
    <h2 id="opportunityemployees">Automation and AI creating new roles</h2>
    <br> As AI replaces phone support and retail stores close low wage employees will seek new roles, our pipeline utilizes these people minor periodic training to produce results.

    <h2 id="missionprocess">Enable existing catalog teams</h2>
    <br> We’re building a system that
    <br> Utilizes existing catalog creation processes, data and systems for eCommerce
    <br> Utilizes retail store SKU vs physical bin location arrangements
    <br> Team composition and full cycle delivery time from training through results. The cost and time to scale the business by utilizing short training cycles for all roles. Depending on non engineering personnel to do the vast majority of
    customizations (arrangements and asset creation and maintenance),the availability of people is much cheaper.

    <h2 id="missionlocal">Local teams renewing techniques</h2>
    Local is important when it comes to training and teaming. Working remote from the office is fine, but not remote from the team or area. With employee turnover and skills that require regular renewing, it’s especially important to have employee
    to employee assistance. The social aspect in collaborating and teaching.
    <h2 id="missionexperience">Technology and commerce experience</h2>
    Write once, run everywhere.
    <br>
    Our focus is process engineering - forming, tooling, training and fueling our teams to produce results. At every step of our process tasks, coding and technique don’t require top level talent or skill. Non engineering tasks are short
    duration that depend on skills that can be learned and renewed with minor training. Virtual Reality tools, formats and techniques are in motion and will require teams to make ongoing improvements in technique and results.
