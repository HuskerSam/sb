  <h1>How to get ready to start coding!</h1>
  <br> Author: SWH 3/1/2018
  <br>
  <br> Developing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)<br> &nbsp; - where coding will be outsourced<br> &nbsp; - delivery time is important<br> &nbsp; - cost is critical<br> &nbsp; - ability to make ongoing changes<br>
  <br> Technologies (libraries, hosting, external webservices), mediums (realtime data, mobile, OG support, search), and how/where to find developers are the things this documents suggests to implement your product functionality.
  <br>
  <br> Our Motto: <b>More code costs more now and later!</b>
  <br> Key Technique: <b>Data Driven Design</b> (add and remove fields using data)
  <br>
  <br> Important things to always keep in mind...<br> &nbsp; How much line count do we get? (avoid automated testing, use popular libraries)
  <br> &nbsp; Who can we hire later to work on this? (try to do things the "normal" way)
  <br> &nbsp; How long will simple or moderate changes take? (use good design and coding techniques)
  <br>
  <h2>Git Source Control Setup</h2> Use <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> to host your source code if you don't already have other ideas. Get the minimum (paid) subscription for private repositories. Source control is a ledger of changes and comments. It's a record of all work, good, bad
  or otherwise. You need to control this, but most of the action will happen from the developers here.

  <br>
  <br>
  <b>If you have specific UI needs...and you do!</b>
  <br> such as your product centers on a displaying graphs, calenders, webgl graphics, etc, you might want to select the specific UI components first, then figure out which (if any) layout and mvc library will work best. This will also help determine
  the charteristics of the backend (such as notifications, OG tags, authorization, email, SMS, etc). Finding a developer with previous experience for your UI components can also help determine what choices libaries throughout the rest of your application.

  <br>
  <br> If a UI component is popular (download/install count), that's a good sign it works now and will work later. Only use popular libraries.

  <h3>To use a layout library?</h3> All projects should focus on the mobile interface first. Most all popular libraries and frameworks allow you to do this.
  <br>
  <br> Different devices require interfaces that respond to touch, portrait or landscape view, low bandwidth or dpi, etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a> from Google shows lots of promise, especially for Android applications that want to look uniform. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Boostrap</a> is older, has a much larger range of third party components,
  but still depends on jQuery and carries a lot of baggage from supporting older browsers.
  <br>
  <br> I recommend using Bootstrap if possible - it's the most popular and probably will be for a while.

  <h3>To use a MVC(binding) library?</h3> Users always like fast applications. Transmitting and / or processing lots of data on demand is never fast.
  <br>
  <br> By providing design guildlines and techniques, these libaries produce a much more uniform code base - multiple developers are able to work seperately and combine their work with a large amount of consistency.
  <br>
  <br> They are template and binding libraries in practice and their use should be limited to that.
  <br>
  <br> These libraries have lots of coding examples - great for less experienced programmers.
  <br>
  <br> Defining your fields with data marginalizes the importance of HTML templates (the layout is data driven - not HTML). Screens will vary - so selecting and using a layout library is more key then the templates themselves.
  <br><br>
  <i>Unless your application requires HTML templates with data binding</i> - <b>I recommend not using one.</b>
  <br><br>
  <a href="">Angular</a>, <a href="">React</a> and <a href="">Vue</a> are popular.
  <br>
  <br> When selecting the MVC library, choosing ES6 or Typescript comes into play.
  <br>&nbsp - Typescript has to be compiled.
  <br>&nbsp - Angular requires Typescript (whether they admit it or not).
  <br>&nbsp - React is lighter then Angular, and a bit more popular.
  <br>&nbsp - Vue is the newest and lightest - easy to read.
  <br>
  <br> Applications should store state on the server, and display a thin layer on the client.
  <br>
  <br> Use the minimum number of components needed, not the maximum. Each component can require it's own HTML, CSS and JS element (file).
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Phone Application Features (Search, Notifications)</h3> When deploying a javascript / web hosted application for iOS or Android, you'll need to wrap it with a native application. <a href="">Electron</a> is the most popular choice for new applications right now. Deploying to the store is no big deal, accessing
  device specific features can be a lot more work. If you require more then notifications, it's a good idea to isolate and control those features early in the project so they don't interfere with interface and database development.

  <h3>Should I use jQuery?</h3>
  <b>No - unless... </b> you use UI components that require it (i.e. Boostrap). ES6 handles DOM manipulation just fine. While there are a ton of popular components that require jQuery, there isn't any reason for new components being developed to depend
  on it.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Data Hosting</h3>
  I prefer Firebase RTDB - especially for the immediate data that drives the interface.  Also for storing any data that will be used for pushing notifications to mobile and other devices.
  <br>
  <br> A heed of warning - NoSQL data design not the same as SQL schema design, and a developer that tells you there isn't much difference isn't experienced. This isn't something to reject a developer on, as if you can do SQL design, you'll be able to
  figure out the NoSQL design at somepoint, but NoSQL tends to carry a hierarchal tree of data related to item, for example a spreadsheet with all of it's sheets and cells stored under one place, another spreadsheet has all of it's data in another seperate
  place (document driven) - where SQL likes to break things up into their parts and join them back together, so all cells are stored in once place, all sheets are stored (without cells) in another place, and put together just when you need them. The document
  driven is far superior for supporting realtime/pushed data.
  <br>
  <h3>Authentication and Server Hosting</h3>
    While there are a range of solutions, Firebase handles the authentication and application hosting with minimal setup and a great set of dev ops tools that install and are well known.  AWS, S3 and Beanstalk are superior solutions for productions in many cases,
    for MVP development Firebase is hard to beat for how much time it takes setup and deploy applications.  Heavy data processing needs should be isolated on EC2 or RDS and the user interface layer stored in Firebase RTDB.
    <h3>Ask for Examples, Expect Fast Results, Be Willing To Pay For Time Spent</h3>
    Most applications are not available for former developers to login and play with - at the same time demand to see some recent examples somewhere.
    <br><br>
    Don't let projects drag on - keep a short time from start to finish on a project.
    <br><br>
    Predicting how long a project will take requires knowing how it will be designed.
    <br><br>
    Expert people are unlikely to design and estimate the cost to implement your technology project for free.


    <h3>Hire a developer with an existing build process and code base.</h3>
    You want to spend your time and energy creating the features specific to your product - not figuring out the newest libraries and technologies.
