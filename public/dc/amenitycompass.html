    Rental agents and property managers have incentive to create and maintain quality lists of local amenities like schools, bus stops and preferred cultural attractions, i.e. restaurants.
    <br><br>
    Location availability and maintenance status can be integrated from existing management systems.
    <br><br>
    User app functions as informational compass rendering virtual view based on mobile location and orientation - much like a compass shows direction this app will show assets in the direction pointed.
    <br><br>
    Soft positioning of the virtual assets smooths loose location and orentation mapping versus the camera stream.
    <br><br>
    Complex virtual assets (not text or shape) will mostly be purchased from the unity store or found free online.
    <br><br>
    Custom virtual assets are expensive to create, while a number of options exist, size not only quality is very important - i.e. 3d cameras tend to create very large assets.
    <br><br>
    Balance expectations and goals with budget - the LA studios are heavy into VR and spending big bucks - small budget movies rarely overtake hollywood productions
    - so mimic where possible, keep it simple and license awesome stuff whenever possible.
    <br><br>
    The reality engine will provide rapid delivery for the prototype - but mvp might be better served with an optimized rendering engine.
    The asset description and location store will quickly become the majority of the intellectual property. Rapid delivery of the rendering
    engine isn't important for the MVP/production version - as the data format for the asset store can be identical (mvp vs prototype).
    <br><br>
    The asset store should cater to delivering/exporting assets (with associated meta data) to any needed consumers (i.e. google maps ar).
    <hr style="clear:both">
     - easy access to videos (maybe including approx location in building)<br>
     - streaming in virtual scene is possible, but quality is usually degraded and bandwidth cost huge<br>
     - reality engine allows html for UI and webGL for virtual elements<br>
     - reality engine uses a hybrid mix of text, data and files for optimal bandwidth (speed and size)<br>
     - virtual objects should focus on visibility and aesthetics over realism and texture quality (size)<br>
     - helmut (stereo camera) mode possible - but html ui is disabled then<br>
     - html ui allows use of any html/javascript library (webGL interface is much more costly)<br>
     - installed application optional; web browser is fine; installed application allows predownload of large assets<br>
     - camera video rendered behind virtual objects is optional - and in many cases may reduce the clarity of the information - i.e. google maps with satelite<br>
     - virtual assets are usually described using between 10-20 fields and a couple files if needed<br>
     - virtual assets are stored in a format that matches the reality engine - in general the assets with simple conversion should work with any engine<br>
